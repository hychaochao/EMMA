}
Generated Response: To determine the correct diagram, let's analyze each option step-by-step:

1. **Diagram A**:
   - The light ray is parallel to the principal axis and passes through the focus \( F \).
   - According to the rules of reflection, a light ray parallel to the principal axis after reflection will pass through the focus.
   - Therefore, the reflected ray should also pass through \( F \).

2. **Diagram B**:
   - The light ray is coming from point \( C \) and is not parallel to the principal axis but directed towards \( P \).
   - The reflected ray does not pass through the focus \( F \), which is incorrect because the incident ray does not seem to be passing through the focus.

3. **Diagram C**:
   - The light ray is coming from point \( C \) and is directed towards \( F \).
   - According to the rules of reflection, a light ray passing through the focus after reflection will become parallel to the principal axis.
   - Therefore, the reflected ray should be parallel to the principal axis.

4. **Diagram D**:
   - The light ray is parallel to the principal axis and passes through the focus \( F \).
   - The reflected ray should be passing through the focus, not parallel to the principal axis, which is incorrect.

From the analyses, Diagram A correctly shows the light ray passing through the focus both before and after reflection, as per the rules of reflection in spherical mirrors.

So, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{A}}
\]

Generated Response: When a ray of light is incident on a spherical mirror parallel to its principal axis, the reflected ray will pass through the focal point (F) of the mirror if it is a concave mirror, or appear to diverge from the focal point if it is a convex mirror.

In this case, since the mirror is concave, the incident ray parallel to the principal axis reflects through the focal point.

Let's analyze the diagrams:

- Diagram A: This shows the incident ray reflecting through the focal point, which is correct for a concave mirror.
- Diagram B: This incorrectly shows the reflected ray diverging from the principal axis.
- Diagram C: This incorrectly shows the reflected ray not passing through the focal point.
- Diagram D: This incorrectly shows the reflected ray not passing through the focal point.

Therefore, the correct diagram is A.

\boxed{A}
