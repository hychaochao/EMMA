}
Generated Response: To determine the correct diagram showing the reflected ray, we need to use the properties of spherical mirrors, particularly a concave mirror. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Incident Ray**: The incident ray travels through the focus \( F \) of the concave mirror.

2. **Determine the Path of the Reflected Ray**: According to the laws of reflection for spherical mirrors, an incident ray passing through the focus \( F \) will reflect parallel to the principal axis (the line passing through the center \( C \) and the focus \( F \)).

3. **Analyze the Diagrams**:
   - **Diagram A**: The reflected ray is shown to be moving away from the mirror in a different direction, which does not follow the rule that it should be parallel to the principal axis.
   - **Diagram B**: The reflected ray is shown to diverge from the principal axis, which again does not follow the reflection rule for the focus.
   - **Diagram C**: The reflected ray is shown to be parallel to the principal axis, which matches the expected behavior of light passing through the focus.
   - **Diagram D**: The reflected ray is shown to be moving in a direction that is not parallel to the principal axis.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the rules of reflection for concave mirrors, the correct diagram showing the reflected ray is Diagram C.

Thus, the correct answer is \(\boxed{C}\).

Generated Response: The problem involves determining the correct path of the reflected ray when a ray of light is incident on a spherical mirror parallel to its principal axis.

1. **Understanding the Mirror and Ray Behavior**:
   - For concave mirrors, rays parallel to the principal axis will converge at the focal point (F) after reflection.
   - For convex mirrors, rays parallel to the principal axis appear to diverge from the focal point (F).

2. **Analyzing Each Diagram**:
   - **Diagram A**: The reflected ray is shown diverging, which suggests the mirror is convex. However, the direction of divergence is incorrect as it does not correctly demonstrate the ray diverging from the focal point.
   - **Diagram B**: The reflected ray is shown parallel to the principal axis. This diagram is incorrect because parallel incident rays should converge at the focal point for concave mirrors or appear to diverge from the focal point for convex mirrors.
   - **Diagram C**: This shows two rays diverging, one from the focal point and the other incorrectly positioned, suggesting it is convex, but the diagram does not correctly follow the ray laws.
   - **Diagram D**: The reflected ray converges at the focal point (F), which is correct for a concave mirror.

3. **Correct Answer**:
   - Diagram D correctly shows the ray converging at the focal point (F), demonstrating the behavior of a concave mirror where parallel rays reflect and converge at the focal point.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\boxed{D}

Generated Response: To determine the path of the incident ray, we need to apply the ray diagram rules for a concave lens. 

When a ray of light passes through a concave lens, the following rules apply:

1. A ray parallel to the principal axis will diverge as if it is coming from the focal point on the same side as the incident ray.
2. A ray passing through the focal point on the same side as the incident ray will emerge parallel to the principal axis.

In the given diagram, the ray emerges in the direction away from the optical center, indicating that it appears to come from the focal point \( F_1 \).

We need to trace back the path of this ray to determine its initial path. The ray that emerges parallel to the principal axis must have passed through the focal point \( F_1 \) before refraction.

Let's analyze the given options:

- Option A shows a ray that passes through \( F_1 \) before entering the lens. However, it refocuses incorrectly.
- Option B shows a ray that passes through \( F_1 \) before entering the lens and correctly diverges parallel to the principal axis after refraction.
- Option C shows a ray that passes through \( F_1 \) before entering the lens, but the direction of the emergent ray is incorrect.
- Option D shows a ray that passes through the lens without passing through the focal point \( F_1 \).

The correct path of the incident ray is that it passes through the focal point \( F_1 \) before entering the lens.

Thus, the correct answer is:

\boxed{B}
