Generated Response: To determine the correct diagram showing the reflected ray, we need to understand the behavior of light rays when they pass through the focus \( F \) of a spherical mirror and then reflect off the mirror.

1. **Incident Ray**: A ray of light passes through the focus \( F \) and then hits the mirror.
2. **Reflection**: According to the laws of reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. For a spherical mirror, any ray passing through the focus will reflect parallel to the principal axis (the line passing through the center of curvature \( C \) and the focus \( F \)).

Let's analyze each diagram:

- **Diagram A**: The incident ray is shown passing through the focus \( F \), but the reflected ray is not parallel to the principal axis. This is incorrect.
- **Diagram B**: The incident ray is shown passing through the focus \( F \), and the reflected ray is parallel to the principal axis. This is correct.
- **Diagram C**: The incident ray is shown passing through the focus \( F \), but the reflected ray is not parallel to the principal axis. This is incorrect.
- **Diagram D**: The incident ray is shown passing through the focus \( F \), but the reflected ray is not parallel to the principal axis. This is incorrect.
- **Diagram E**: The incident ray is shown passing through the focus \( F \), but the reflected ray is not parallel to the principal axis. This is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct diagram is **Diagram B**.

The answer is \(\boxed{B}\).

  "response": "To determine which diagram correctly shows the reflected ray when a ray of light is incident on a spherical mirror parallel to its principal axis, we need to understand the behavior of light rays in spherical mirrors.\n\n1. **Incident Ray**: A ray of light incident on a spherical mirror parallel to its principal axis will hit the mirror at a point equidistant from the center of curvature (C) and the focal point (F).\n\n2. **Reflection Law**: According to the law of reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
