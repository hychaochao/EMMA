Generated Response: To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of light rays when they strike a spherical mirror. The key principle here is the law of reflection, which states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.

In the given problem, the light ray passes through the focal point \( F \) of the spherical mirror and then strikes the mirror. For a spherical mirror, any ray passing through the focus will reflect parallel to the principal axis.

Let's analyze each option:

**Option A:** The reflected ray is shown as reflecting parallel to the principal axis. This is consistent with the law of reflection for a spherical mirror, as rays passing through the focus reflect parallel to the principal axis.

**Option B:** The reflected ray is shown as reflecting at an angle to the principal axis. This does not follow the law of reflection and is therefore incorrect.

**Option C:** The reflected ray is shown as reflecting back through the focus. This is incorrect because rays passing through the focus reflect parallel to the principal axis.

**Option D:** The reflected ray is shown as reflecting parallel to the principal axis, but the direction is incorrect. The correct direction should be away from the mirror in a straight line parallel to the principal axis.

Based on this analysis, the correct diagram is:

\boxed{A}

Generated Response: To solve this problem, we need to understand how light rays behave when they are incident on a spherical mirror, particularly a concave mirror as shown in the diagram. A spherical mirror has a principal axis, a center of curvature (C), and a focal point (F).

For a concave mirror, parallel rays of light that are incident on the mirror will reflect through the focal point (F) after reflection. This is a fundamental property of concave mirrors.

Now, let's analyze each option:

**Option A**:
- The incident ray is parallel to the principal axis.
- The reflected ray seems to be diverging rather than converging at the focal point.

**Option B**:
- The incident ray is parallel to the principal axis.
- The reflected ray passes through the focal point (F), which is consistent with the properties of a concave mirror.

**Option C**:
- The incident ray is parallel to the principal axis.
- The reflected rays appear to be diverging and not passing through the focal point.

**Option D**:
- The incident ray is parallel to the principal axis.
- The reflected ray is directed away from the focal point, indicating divergence.

Based on the properties of a concave mirror, the correct option should show the reflected ray passing through the focal point (F). Therefore, the correct answer is:

\boxed{B}
