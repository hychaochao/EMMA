    "solution": "['Let us analyse, what would be the change of the magnetic energy when one of the straws is displaced to a small distance. The magnetic field inside the tubes will remain constant due to the conservation of magnetic flux, but outside, the magnetic field will be changed. The magnetic field outside the straws is defined by the following condition: there is no circulation of $\\\\vec{B}$ (because there are no currents outside the straws); there are no sources of the field lines, other than the endpoints of the straws; each of the endpoints of the straws is a source of streamlines with a fixed magnetic flux $\\\\pm \\\\Phi$. These are exactly the same condition as those which define the electric field of four charges $\\\\pm Q$. We know that if the distance between charges is much larger than the geometrical size of a charge, the charges can be considered as point charges (the electric field near the charges remains almost constant, so that the respective contribution to the change of the overall electric field energy is negligible). Therefore we can conclude that the endpoints of the straws can be considered as magnetic point charges. In order to calculate the force between two magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles), we need to establish the correspondence between magnetic and electric quantities.\\n\\nFor two electric charges $Q$ separated by a distance $a$, the force is $F=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{2}}$, and at the position of one charge, the electric field of the other charge has energy density $w=\\\\frac{1}{32 \\\\pi^{2} \\\\varepsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{4}}$; hence we can write $F=8 \\\\pi w a^{2}$. This is a universal expression for the force (for the case when the field lines have the same shape as in the case of two opposite and equal by modulus electric charges) relying only on the energy density, and not related to the nature of the field; so we can apply it to the magnetic\\n\\n\\n\\nfield. Indeed, the force can be calculated as a derivative of the full field energy with respect to a virtual displacement of a field line source (electric or magnetic charge); if the energy densities of two fields are respectively equal at one point, they are equal everywhere, and so are equal the full field energies. As it follows from the Gauss law, for a point source of a fixed magnetic flux $\\\\Phi$ at a distance $a$, the induction $B=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\Phi}{a^{2}}$.

The space between the sphere and the shell would experience an electric field due to the charge on the sphere.

    "solution": "[\"The key idea is that the superconducting loop must have constant flux. If it did not, by Faraday's Law, an emf\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{E}=-\\\\frac{d \\\\Phi}{d t}\\n$$\\n\\nwould be generated in the loop. Since superconducting materials have no resistance, this would imply an infinite current, hence a contradiction.\\n\\nWe will first compute the flux through the rectangular loop when there is a current $I_{1}$. Since $w \\\\ll \\\\ell$, we can assume that the vertical segments produce negligible amounts of magnetic field. We can furthermore approximate the field produced by one of the horizontal wires a distance $r$ away as\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I}{2 \\\\pi r}$ (this is valid for an infinitely long wire, and therefore is also valid in the regime where $w \\\\ll \\\\ell$ ).\\n\\nThus, the total flux through the rectangular loop when there is a current $I_{1}$ is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Phi_{1}=\\\\int_{r}^{w} B\\\\left(\\\\ell d r^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)=\\\\int_{r}^{w-r}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{1}}{2 \\\\pi r^{\\\\prime}}+\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{1}}{2 \\\\pi\\\\left(w-r^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)}\\\\right) \\\\ell d r^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{1} \\\\ell}{\\\\pi} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{w}{r}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nNote that the self inductance of the loop is $L=\\\\frac{\\\\Phi}{I_{1}}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell}{\\\\pi} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{w}{r}\\\\right)$.\\n\\nNow, we will determine the flux through the rectangular loop due to the long current-carrying wire. This is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Phi_{2}=\\\\int_{d}^{d+w} \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\\\pi r}(\\\\ell d r)=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2} \\\\ell}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{d+w}{d}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nThe mutual inductance is $M=\\\\frac{\\\\Phi_{2}}{I_{2}}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{d+w}{d}\\\\right)$. In to maintain the same flux in the loop, the current will change to $I_{3}$ where\\n\\n$$\\nL I_{1}=M I_{2}+L I_{3}\\n$$\\n\\nor\\n\\n$$\\nI_{3}=I_{1}-\\\\frac{M}{L} I_{2}\\n$$\\n\\nNow, we compute the force between the rectangular loop and the long, current-carrying wire. The forces on the vertical sides cancel out because the current in the loop is in opposite directions on these sides. From the horizontal sides, we have the force is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\nF=\\\\sum\\\\left(I_{3} \\\\vec{\\\\ell} \\\\times \\\\vec{B}\\\\right) & =I_{3} \\\\ell\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\\\pi d}-\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\\\pi(d+w)}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\n& =\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell w}{2 \\\\pi d(d+w)}\\\\left[I_{2}\\\\left(I_{1}-\\\\frac{M}{L} I_{2}\\\\right)\\\\right] .\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nThis quadratic in $I_{2}$ is maximized when $I_{2}=\\\\frac{L}{2 M} I_{1}$ in which case the force becomes\\n\\n$$\\nF=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell w}{2 \\\\pi d(d+w)} \\\\frac{L I_{1}^{2}}{4 M}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell w I_{1}^{2}}{4 \\\\pi d(d+w)} \\\\frac{\\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{w}{r}\\\\right)}{\\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{d+w}{d}\\\\right)}\\n$$\\n\\nNote: If the size of the wires is considered when computing flux, a slightly different answer is obtained.

Since the side of the square is \\(d\\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{d \\sqrt{2}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the electric field due to each charge:**\n   Each charge \\(q\\) at distance \\(r = \\frac{d \\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) produces an electric field:\n   \\[\n   E_q = \\frac{kq}{\\left(\\frac{d \\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{kq}{\\frac{d^2}{2}} = \\frac{2kq}{d^2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Vector addition of electric fields:**\n   - **Top-left (\\(-q\\))**: Electric field points towards the charge, so the direction is diagonally downward to the right.\n   - **Top-right (\\(-q\\))**: Electric field points towards the charge, so the direction is diagonally downward to the left.\n   - **Bottom-left (\\(+q\\))**: Electric field points away from the charge, so the direction is diagonally upward to the right.\n   - **Bottom-right (\\(-q\\))**: Electric field points towards the charge, so the direction is diagonally upward to the left.\n\n   These vector directions can be analyzed in terms of their components:\n   - The \\(+q\\) charge at the bottom-left will contribute an electric field with components \\(\\frac{2kq}{d^2}\\) in the positive \\(x\\)-direction and positive \\(y\\)-direction.\n   - The \\(-q\\) charge at the top-left will contribute an electric field with components \\(\\frac{2kq}{d^2}\\) in the negative \\(x\\)-direction and negative \\(y\\)-direction.\n   - The \\(-q\\) charge at the top-right will contribute an electric field with components \\(\\frac{2kq}{d^2}\\) in the negative \\(x\\)-direction and negative \\(y\\)-direction.\n   - The \\(-q\\) charge at the bottom-right will contribute an electric field with components \\(\\frac{2kq}{d^2}\\) in the positive \\(x\\)-direction and positive \\(y\\)-direction.\n\n5. **Sum the components:**\n   - In the \\(x\\)-direction:\n     \\[\n     E_x = \\frac{2kq}{d^2} - \\frac{2kq}{d^2} + \\frac{2kq}{d^2} - \\frac{2kq}{d^2} = 0\n     \\]\n   - In the \\(y\\)-direction:\n     \\[\n     E_y = \\frac{2kq}{d^2} - \\frac{2kq}{d^2} + \\frac{2kq}{d^2} - \\frac{2kq}{d^2} = 0\n     \\]\n\n   **However, this is not correct. Let's re-evaluate:**\n\n   On further inspection, the correct approach is recognizing that the fields from the charges at diagonally opposite corners cancel each other out due to symmetry. Therefore, the net electric field at point \\(X\\) is due to the two remaining charges:\n   - The \\(+q\\) at the bottom-left produces a field in the positive \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions.\n   - The \\(-q\\) at the bottom-right produces a field in the negative \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions.\n\n   The net electric field is:\n   \\[\n   E = \\frac{2kq}{d^2} + \\frac{2kq}{d^2} = \\frac{4kq}{d^2}\n   \\]\n   directed towards the \\(+q\\) charge in the bottom-left corner.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",
