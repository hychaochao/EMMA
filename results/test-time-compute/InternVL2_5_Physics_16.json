    "solution": "['Let us analyse, what would be the change of the magnetic energy when one of the straws is displaced to a small distance. The magnetic field inside the tubes will remain constant due to the conservation of magnetic flux, but outside, the magnetic field will be changed. The magnetic field outside the straws is defined by the following condition: there is no circulation of $\\\\vec{B}$ (because there are no currents outside the straws); there are no sources of the field lines, other than the endpoints of the straws; each of the endpoints of the straws is a source of streamlines with a fixed magnetic flux $\\\\pm \\\\Phi$. These are exactly the same condition as those which define the electric field of four charges $\\\\pm Q$. We know that if the distance between charges is much larger than the geometrical size of a charge, the charges can be considered as point charges (the electric field near the charges remains almost constant, so that the respective contribution to the change of the overall electric field energy is negligible). Therefore we can conclude that the endpoints of the straws can be considered as magnetic point charges. In order to calculate the force between two magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles), we need to establish the correspondence between magnetic and electric quantities.\\n\\nFor two electric charges $Q$ separated by a distance $a$, the force is $F=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{2}}$, and at the position of one charge, the electric field of the other charge has energy density $w=\\\\frac{1}{32 \\\\pi^{2} \\\\varepsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{4}}$; hence we can write $F=8 \\\\pi w a^{2}$. This is a universal expression for the force (for the case when the field lines have the same shape as in the case of two opposite and equal by modulus electric charges) relying only on the energy density, and not related to the nature of the field; so we can apply it to the magnetic\\n\\n\\n\\nfield. Indeed, the force can be calculated as a derivative of the full field energy with respect to a virtual displacement of a field line source (electric or magnetic charge); if the energy densities of two fields are respectively equal at one point, they are equal everywhere, and so are equal the full field energies. As it follows from the Gauss law, for a point source of a fixed magnetic flux $\\\\Phi$ at a distance $a$, the induction $B=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\Phi}{a^{2}}$.

This field exists because the conducting shell has no net charge, and thus cannot cancel out the field from the sphere. Therefore, statement B is true.\n\n3. **Electric Field Above the Outer Surface of the Conducting Shell:**\n   - The conducting shell has no net charge, but it will have induced charges on its inner and outer surfaces to shield the internal electric field. However, above the outer surface of the conducting shell, the electric field due to the induced charges on the shell will cancel out the field due to the non-conducting sphere, resulting in a net electric field of zero in the region outside the shell.

The space between the sphere and the shell would experience an electric field due to the charge on the sphere. Since the shell has no net charge and is a conductor, it will redistribute the charge in such a way that the electric field inside the conductor is zero, but not necessarily in the space between the sphere and the shell.\n\n**Statement C: There is an electric field above the outer surface of the conducting shell.**\n- This statement is true.

The electric field produced by the non-conducting sphere extends beyond the shell, causing an electric field in the region outside the shell.\n\n**Statement D: All points in the conducting shell are at the same electric potential.**\n- This statement is true. In a conductor, electrostatic equilibrium dictates that the electric potential is constant throughout the conductor.
