The goal is to maximize the length of overlap between the two wires when one is placed over the other.\n\n### Step 2: Describe the overlap\nThe overlap occurs when the two wires coincide along one or more segments.

The side lengths are \\(\\sqrt{8}, \\sqrt{10}, \\sqrt{13}\\), and all angles are less than \\(90^\\circ\\).\n\nThus, an acute triangle **can** be formed.\n\n---\n\n#### D: Obtuse triangle\nAn obtuse triangle is a triangle where one angle is greater than \\(90^\\circ\\).\n\n- Points \\(A, C, F\\) form an obtuse triangle. The angle at \\(C\\) is greater than \\(90^\\circ\\) because the side lengths satisfy the Pythagorean inequality for an obtuse triangle.\n\nThus, an obtuse triangle **can** be formed.\n\n---\n\n#### E: All figures are possible\nSince we have shown that all the figures mentioned (square, parallelogram with different long sides, acute triangle, and obtuse triangle) can be formed, this option suggests that no figure is impossible.\n\nHowever, we must test the claim by checking for any contradictions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identify the figure that cannot be formed\nBy careful analysis, we observe that all the figures described above **can** be formed.

A cube has 6 faces, and the arrangement of squares in the net must allow it to fold into a cube.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the net\nThe given net consists of 7 squares labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. For the net to fold into a cube:\n- Each square must be connected to at least one other square along an edge.\n- The squares must align properly to form the six faces of a cube without overlaps.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the squares\nThe net currently has an extra square. Removing one square should leave the other 6 squares connected in a way that forms a valid cube. We will test removing each of the squares one by one:\n\n#### Case A: Remove square **3**\nIf square 3 is removed, the remaining squares (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7) are still connected. The net can fold into a cube:\n- Square 1 connects to squares 2, 6, and 5.\n- Square 4 connects to square 5.\n- Square 2 connects to square 6.\nThis forms a valid cube.\n\n#### Case B: Remove square **4**\nIf square 4 is removed, the remaining squares (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) are still connected. The net can fold into a cube:\n- Square 1 connects to squares 2, 6, and 5.\n- Square 2 connects to square 3.\n- Square 6 connects to square 7.\nThis forms a valid cube.\n\n#### Case C: Remove square **7**\nIf square 7 is removed, the remaining squares (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are still connected. The net can fold into a cube:\n- Square 1 connects to squares 2, 6, and 5.\n- Square 4 connects to square 5.\n- Square 2 connects to square 3.\nThis forms a valid cube.\n\n### Step 3: Eliminating other possibilities\nRemoving any square other than 3, 4, or 7 would disconnect the net or make it impossible to fold into a cube. Thus, only squares 3, 4, or 7 can be removed.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe squares that can be removed are **3**, **4**, or **7**. Thus, the correct option is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{E}\\)",

The **red square** and the **green triangle** cannot be on opposite sides because both are shown adjacent to each other in the first view.\n2. The **yellow star** is adjacent to the **red square**, so it cannot be opposite to it.\n3. The **kangaroo** does not appear in either view, so it must be on the face opposite the **blue circle** (since the blue circle is on the front in the second orientation).\n\n### Step 4: Verify the answer\nFrom the second orientation, the kangaroo is opposite the **blue circle**. Therefore, the figure opposite the kangaroo must be the **blue circle**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe figure on the face opposite to the kangaroo is the **blue circle**.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{A}\\)",

If the wedge corresponds to some specific fraction of \\(360^\\circ\\), its volume will be the same fraction of the cylinder's volume.\n\nIn this case, the wedge appears to correspond to **one-sixth of the cylinder** because the dashed curve divides the cylinder into \\(6\\) equal slices.\n\nThus, the volume of the wedge is:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{wedge}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot V_{\\text{cylinder}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the wedge's volume\nSubstitute \\(V_{\\text{cylinder}} = 72\\pi\\) into the equation:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{wedge}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot (72\\pi) = 12\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3.\n\\]\n\nUsing an approximation for \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14\\), we get:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{wedge}} \\approx 12 \\cdot 3.14 = 37.68 \\, \\text{cm}^3.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Closest answer\nThe closest answer choice to \\(37.68\\) is **\\(48 \\, \\text{cm}^3\\)**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",

For the outer circle:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of outer semicircle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2\\pi \\cdot 20 = 20\\pi \\, \\text{meters}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Length of the straight horizontal line connecting the outer circle to the inner circle\nThe radius of the outer circle is \\(20\\) meters, and the radius of the inner circle is \\(10\\) meters. The straight horizontal line connecting the two circles has a length equal to the difference in their radii:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of horizontal line} = 20 - 10 = 10 \\, \\text{meters}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Length of the inner semicircle\nFor the inner circle with radius \\(10\\), the length of the semicircle is:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of inner semicircle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2\\pi \\cdot 10 = 10\\pi \\, \\text{meters}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Length of the straight horizontal line connecting the inner circle back to the outer circle\nThe aardvark retraces its path along the horizontal line connecting the inner circle to the outer circle.

The setup looks like this:\n\n\\[\n\\text{(Right) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2190 (Left)}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the swapping rule\n- Any two kangaroos that are **facing each other** (a kangaroo facing right next to a kangaroo facing left) can swap positions.\n- Once they swap, they will no longer be facing each other, so no further swaps between those two are possible.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Counting the number of swaps\n- The key is to count how many swaps will occur.

    "solution": "Note that we want the path drawn out by the lasers to come back to $P$ in as few steps as possible. Observe that if a laser is fired with an angle of $n$ degrees from the tangent, then the number of points it creates on the circle is $\\frac{180}{\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)}$. (Consider the regular polygon created by linking all the points that show up on the circle-if the center of the circle is $\\mathrm{O}$, and the vertices are numbered $V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_k$, the angle $\\angle V_1 O V_2$ is equal to $2 \\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)$, so there are a total of $\\frac{360}{2 \\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)}$ sides).\\nNow, we consider the case with both $n$ and $n+1$. Note that we wish to minimize the value $\\frac{180}{\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)}+$ $\\frac{180}{\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n+1)}$, or maximize both $\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n+1)$.

This occurs when $n=80$. Plugging this into our expression, we have that the number of points that show up from the laser fired at 80 degrees is $\\frac{180}{20}=9$ and the number of points that appear from the laser fired at 81 degrees is $\\frac{180}{9}=20$.

    "response_0": "To solve this problem, we will analyze the geometry and reflection properties of the circular room and determine the minimum number of illuminated points.\n\n### Step 1: Geometry of the problem\nThe circular room has reflective walls, and the laser beams are emitted at angles of \\( n^\\circ \\) and \\( (n+1)^\\circ \\) with respect to the tangent at point \\( P \\). Each laser beam reflects off the walls following the law of reflection.\n\nThe key observation here is that the path of the laser beams can be analyzed using **angles and periodicity** in a polygonal path. The laser beams return to \\( P \\) after completing a certain number of reflections, forming a closed path. The number of unique illuminated points corresponds to the number of reflections before the beams return to \\( P \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Reflections and periodicity\nFor a laser beam emitted at an angle \\( \\theta \\) with respect to the tangent, the points of intersection of the beam with the wall can be analyzed using modular arithmetic over a **circle of 360 degrees**.\n\n#### First beam:\nThe first beam is emitted at an angle \\( n^\\circ \\). It will hit the wall at increments of \\( 2n^\\circ \\) around the circle (since the angle doubles with each reflection). The beam returns to \\( P \\) when \\( 2n \\times k = 360m \\), where \\( k \\) is the number of reflections, and \\( m \\) is an integer. Simplifying:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{180m}{n}.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( k \\) must be the smallest integer such that \\( \\frac{180m}{n} \\) is an integer. This is equivalent to finding the **least common multiple (LCM)** of \\( 180 \\) and \\( n \\), divided by \\( n \\).\n\n#### Second beam:\nThe second beam is emitted at an angle \\( (n+1)^\\circ \\). A similar analysis shows that the beam returns to \\( P \\) after \\( k' = \\frac{180m'}{n+1} \\) reflections, where \\( m' \\) is an integer.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Minimum number of unique illuminated points\nThe total number of unique illuminated points corresponds to the least common multiple of the number of reflections for both beams, \\( k \\) and \\( k' \\). Therefore, we need to compute:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(k, k').\n\\]\n\n#### Key observation:\nFor the two beams to illuminate the **minimum number of points**, \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\) should be **coprime**. This ensures that the illuminated points do not overlap unnecessarily.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Specific case for \\( n = 89 \\)\nTo minimize the number of illuminated points, choose \\( n \\) as large as possible under the constraint \\( n < 90 \\). Let \\( n = 89 \\). Then:\n\n- First beam: Reflections occur at \\( 2(89)^\\circ = 178^\\circ \\), and the beam returns after \\( k = \\frac{180}{\\gcd(180, 89)} = 180 \\) reflections.\n- Second beam: Reflections occur at \\( 2(90)^\\circ = 180^\\circ \\), and the beam returns after \\( k' = \\frac{180}{\\gcd(180, 90)} = 2 \\) reflections.\n\nThe total number of unique illuminated points is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(k, k') = \\text{LCM}(180, 2) = 180.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{180}\n\\]",

Therefore:\n  \\[\n  \\angle BAC + \\angle ACB + \\angle ABC = 180^\\circ,\n  \\]\n  and since \\( \\angle BAC = \\angle ACB \\),\n  \\[\n  2\\angle BAC + \\beta = 180^\\circ.\n  \\]\n  Substituting \\( \\beta = 1.994^\\circ \\):\n  \\[\n  2\\angle BAC + 1.994^\\circ = 180^\\circ,\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  2\\angle BAC = 178.006^\\circ,\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\angle BAC = \\angle ACB = 89.003^\\circ.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Path of the Light Beam\n- The beam starts at \\( C \\), where it reflects with an angle of incidence \\( \\alpha = 19.94^\\circ \\).\n- After reflecting at \\( C \\), the beam proceeds toward \\( AB \\).\n- At \\( AB \\), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\n- The beam continues to reflect alternately between \\( \\overline{AB} \\) and \\( \\overline{BC} \\).\n\nKey insight: After each reflection, the beam \"climbs\" closer to the vertex \\( B \\). The reflection process will terminate when the beam exits the triangle through one of the sides.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Reflections\nThe light beam bounces off the two sides in a predictable pattern:\n1. At each reflection, the beam shifts slightly closer to \\( B \\).\n2. The total number of reflections depends on the geometry of the triangle and the initial angle of incidence.\n\nThe key to solving this is to determine how many reflections the beam undergoes before it exits the triangle. Using the geometry and angles given:\n- The beam will reflect **10 times** in total. This includes the first reflection at \\( C \\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",

This means that the grid has \\(7 \\times 7 = 49\\) points.\n\n#### Step 2: Movement possibilities\nAt each point, you can move:\n1. **Right** to the next column in the same row.\n2. **Down** to the next row in the same column.\n3. **Diagonally down-right** to the next row and next column simultaneously.\n\nThe number of paths to each point in the grid depends on the sum of the paths leading into it from its valid neighboring points.\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate the number of paths using dynamic programming\nLet \\(P(i, j)\\) represent the number of ways to reach the point in the \\(i\\)-th row and \\(j\\)-th column (zero-indexed). We initialize the grid with the following base case:\n- \\(P(0, 0) = 1\\), since there is only one way to start at the top-left corner.\n\nFor each subsequent point \\((i, j)\\), the number of paths is given by:\n\\[\nP(i, j) = P(i-1, j) + P(i, j-1) + P(i-1, j-1),\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(P(i-1, j)\\) represents the number of paths coming from above (downward move),\n- \\(P(i, j-1)\\) represents the number of paths coming from the left (rightward move),\n- \\(P(i-1, j-1)\\) represents the number of paths coming from the top-left (diagonal move).\n\nIf \\(i < 0\\) or \\(j < 0\\), we set \\(P(i, j) = 0\\), as those points are outside the grid.\n\n#### Step 4: Iteratively compute the paths\nWe construct a \\(7 \\times 7\\) grid and compute \\(P(i, j)\\) for each point iteratively:\n\n1. **Row 0:** All points in the first row can only be reached by moving right, so \\(P(0, j) = 1\\) for all \\(j\\).\n2. **Column 0:** All points in the first column can only be reached by moving down, so \\(P(i, 0) = 1\\) for all \\(i\\).\n3. **Remaining points:** Use the recurrence relation to compute paths for all other points.\n\nThe computations proceed as follows:\n\n- \\(P(0, 0) = 1\\),\n- \\(P(0, 1) = 1, P(0, 2) = 1, \\dots, P(0, 6) = 1\\),\n- \\(P(1, 0) = 1, P(2, 0) = 1, \\dots, P(6, 0) = 1\\),\n- For \\(P(1, 1): P(1, 1) = P(0, 1) + P(1, 0) + P(0, 0) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\\),\n- For \\(P(1, 2): P(1, 2) = P(0, 2) + P(1, 1) + P(0, 1) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5\\),\n- Continue this process for all points.\n\n#### Step 5: Final value\nAfter filling the grid using the recurrence relation, the value at \\(P(6, 6)\\) (bottom-right corner) is the total number of distinct paths from January 1 to December 31.\n\nThe final result is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1716}\n\\]",

    "response_0": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the rolling motion of the smaller disk around the larger clock face and determine where the smaller disk becomes tangent to the clock face when the arrow is next pointing in the upward vertical direction.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Key observations\n1. The larger clock face has a radius of \\( R = 20 \\, \\text{cm} \\), and the smaller disk has a radius of \\( r = 10 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n2. The smaller disk rolls without slipping around the larger clock face.\n3. Rolling without slipping means the arc length traveled by the smaller disk is equal to the arc length it rolls along the larger clock face.\n4. The arrow initially points upward, and we are tasked with finding when it next points upward again.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understanding rotation and rolling\n#### (a) Circumference of the smaller disk and the larger clock face\n- The circumference of the larger clock face is:\n  \\[\n  C_{\\text{large}} = 2 \\pi R = 2 \\pi (20) = 40\\pi \\, \\text{cm}.\n  \\]\n- The circumference of the smaller disk is:\n  \\[\n  C_{\\text{small}} = 2 \\pi r = 2 \\pi (10) = 20\\pi \\, \\text{cm}.\n  \\]\n\n#### (b) How far the smaller disk rolls before the arrow points upward again\nThe arrow on the smaller disk completes one full rotation when it rolls a distance equal to the circumference of the smaller disk, \\( 20\\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\). Therefore, the smaller disk completes one full rotation for every \\( 20\\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\) of arc length rolled along the larger clock face.\n\nHowever, the smaller disk does not only rotate due to its rolling. Because it is rolling around the larger clock face, it also rotates due to the curvature of the larger clock face. This additional rotation must be accounted for.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Total rotation of the smaller disk\nThe smaller disk makes two types of rotations:\n1. **Intrinsic rotation due to rolling:** As the smaller disk rolls a distance equal to the circumference of the larger clock face (\\( 40\\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\)), it completes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Intrinsic rotations} = \\frac{40\\pi}{20\\pi} = 2 \\, \\text{full rotations}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rotation due to the curvature of the larger clock face:** As the smaller disk rolls around the larger circle, it also rotates once for every revolution around the larger clock face. Since the smaller disk completes one full revolution around the clock face, it rotates an additional \\( 1 \\, \\text{full rotation} \\).\n\nThus, the total rotation of the smaller disk after one complete revolution around the clock face is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total rotations} = \\text{Intrinsic rotations} + \\text{Curvature-induced rotations} = 2 + 1 = 3 \\, \\text{full rotations}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Determining when the arrow points upward again\nFor the arrow to point upward again, the smaller disk must complete an integer number of full rotations. Since the smaller disk completes 3 full rotations after rolling once around the clock face, the arrow will point upward again when the disk is tangent to the clock face at its initial position (\\( 12 \\, \\text{o'clock} \\)).\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the first time the arrow points upward again **before completing a full revolution**. To find this, we calculate how far the disk needs to roll to complete 1 full rotation of the arrow.\n\n#### (a) Distance rolled for 1 full rotation\nThe smaller disk completes one full rotation when it rolls a distance equal to its own circumference, \\( 20\\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\n#### (b) Arc length on the larger clock face\nThe arc length rolled on the larger clock face corresponds to the distance the smaller disk rolls. Since the smaller disk rolls \\( 20\\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\), the corresponding angle subtended at the center of the larger clock face is:\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{\\text{Arc length}}{\\text{Radius}} = \\frac{20\\pi}{20} = \\pi \\, \\text{radians}.\n\\]\n\n#### (c) Conversion to clock positions\nAn angle of \\( \\pi \\, \\text{radians} \\) corresponds to half the circumference of the larger clock face, which is equivalent to moving from \\( 12 \\, \\text{o'clock} \\) to \\( 6 \\, \\text{o'clock} \\).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nThe smaller disk will be tangent to the larger clock face at \\( \\boxed{\\text{6 o'clock}} \\) when the arrow is next pointing in the upward vertical direction.",

Both triangles are drawn to scale, and their shapes indicate that they are non-overlapping and separated.\n2. By inspecting the geometry, the line segments connecting certain vertex pairs will cross the interior of one of the triangles.\n\n#### Key insight:\n- If we carefully analyze the positions of the vertices and the triangles' shapes, **any line segment joining adjacent vertices across the triangles will cross one of the triangles.**\n- However, certain pairs of vertices that are farthest apart (e.g., \\( A \\) and \\( F \\)) will not cause the line to cross either triangle.\n\nThus, we need to systematically examine which pairs satisfy the condition.\n\n### Step 3: Valid pairs\n#### Case 1: Vertex \\( A \\) (from Triangle 1)\n- Pair \\( (A, D) \\): Line crosses Triangle 1 \u2192 Invalid.\n- Pair \\( (A, E) \\): Line crosses Triangle 1 \u2192 Invalid.\n- Pair \\( (A, F) \\): Line does not cross any triangle \u2192 Valid.\n\n#### Case 2: Vertex \\( B \\) (from Triangle 1)\n- Pair \\( (B, D) \\): Line crosses Triangle 1 \u2192 Invalid.\n- Pair \\( (B, E) \\): Line does not cross any triangle \u2192 Valid.\n- Pair \\( (B, F) \\): Line crosses Triangle 2 \u2192 Invalid.\n\n#### Case 3: Vertex \\( C \\) (from Triangle 1)\n- Pair \\( (C, D) \\): Line does not cross any triangle \u2192 Valid.\n- Pair \\( (C, E) \\): Line crosses Triangle 2 \u2192 Invalid.\n- Pair \\( (C, F) \\): Line crosses Triangle 2 \u2192 Invalid.\n\n### Step 4: Count the valid pairs\nFrom the analysis above, the valid pairs are:\n1. \\( (A, F) \\)\n2. \\( (B, E) \\)\n3. \\( (C, D) \\)\n\nThus, there are **3 valid pairs**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

    "response_0": "To solve this problem, we will analyze the ant's position after 2019 minutes based on the structure of the network and the parity of the ant's movements. The key idea is to determine whether the ant can reach a specific vertex after 2019 moves, considering the connectivity of the graph and the alternating nature of its movement.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the network structure\nThe network consists of an **outer ring** of 8 vertices, and an **inner ring** of 4 vertices (labeled \\(P, Q, R, S\\)), which are connected to the outer ring. The movement of the ant is restricted to the edges of this graph.\n\n- **Odd and even vertices**: \n  - The ant alternates between odd and even vertices as it moves along the edges.\n  - The \"Start\" vertex is part of the **outer ring**, which alternates between odd and even steps as the ant moves.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Parity of movement\n- The ant starts at the **Start** vertex at \\(t = 0\\).\n- Each move takes the ant to a neighboring vertex. Thus:\n  - After **odd-numbered moves** (\\(t = 1, 3, 5, \\dots\\)), the ant is on a vertex *one step away* from the Start vertex.\n  - After **even-numbered moves** (\\(t = 2, 4, 6, \\dots\\)), the ant is on a vertex *two steps away* (or back to the Start vertex itself).\n\nFor \\(t = 2019\\), the number of moves is **odd**. Thus, the ant must be on a vertex that is reachable by an odd number of moves from the Start vertex.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Reachability of \\(P, Q, R, S, T\\)\n1. **Vertices \\(P, Q, R, S\\)**:\n   - These vertices are part of the **inner ring**.\n   - To reach any of these vertices from the Start, the ant must first move to the outer ring (even-numbered moves) and then transition to the inner ring (odd-numbered moves).\n   - Since \\(2019\\) is odd, the ant can **only** be on the inner ring vertices (\\(P, Q, R, S\\)) at this time.\n\n2. **Vertex \\(T\\)**:\n   - Vertex \\(T\\) is part of the **outer ring**.\n   - The ant can only be on the outer ring at an even-numbered move. Since \\(2019\\) is odd, the ant **cannot** be on \\(T\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nAfter 2019 minutes, the ant can only be on one of the vertices \\(P, Q, R, S\\). This corresponds to **option A**: \"only \\(P, R\\) or \\(S\\)\".\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",

The sums of the first two crosses are \\(17\\) and \\(22\\), increasing by \\(5\\). Thus, the sum of the third cross should be:\n\\[\n22 + 5 = 27\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the missing number\nThe known numbers in the third cross are:\n\\[\n7 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 23\n\\]\nTo make the total \\(27\\), the missing number must be:\n\\[\n27 - 23 = 4\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
