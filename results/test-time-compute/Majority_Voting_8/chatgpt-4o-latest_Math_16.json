We need to group patterns that are identical under these transformations. To do this, we classify the distinct patterns based on the relative positions of the two shaded squares.\n\n#### Case 1: Shaded squares are adjacent\nTwo squares are adjacent if they share an edge.

A **regular hexagon** has six equal sides and six equal angles (each \\(120^\\circ\\)).\n2. By folding the three marked corners (black dots) to the center \\(O\\), these corners overlap at the center, creating triangular folds.\n3.

Similarly, folding all three marked corners to the center will lead to overlapping triangular regions.\n\nWe need to determine the resulting figure after folding.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Symmetry and Overlaps\n1. The three marked corners of the hexagon are evenly spaced. In a regular hexagon, the angles between adjacent corners are \\( 120^{\\circ} \\). Thus, the three marked corners form an equilateral triangle.\n\n2. When these three corners are folded to meet at the center, they overlap symmetrically, forming a new polygon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Sides of the Resulting Figure\n- Each folded triangular flap contributes two edges to the boundary of the resulting figure. These edges come from the sides of the regular hexagon that are folded inward.\n- Since there are three marked corners (and hence three flaps), there will be \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\) edges in total.\n\nThus, the resulting figure is a **hexagon**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nThe resulting figure is a hexagon.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",

The shape of the unrolled paper depends on where \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are positioned:\n   - \\(X\\) is at the bottom-left of the rectangle.\n   - \\(Y\\) is somewhere on the right edge of the rectangle, higher than \\(X\\).\n\nThus, the lower part of the paper will form a **trapezoid** shape, where:\n   - The bottom edge is the original base of the rectangle.\n   - The top edge is the diagonal line \\(XY\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Matching with the options\nFrom the given options:\n- **Option D** represents a trapezoid, where the bottom edge is horizontal, and the top edge is slanted (diagonal line \\(XY\\)).\n- This matches the expected result of unrolling the lower part of the paper.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",
    "response_7": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shape that forms when the rectangular piece of paper, which was wrapped around the cylinder, is unrolled after the straight angled cut is made along the cylinder from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the cut\nThe cut from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\) is at an angle to the axis of the cylinder. When this cut is made, it creates a diagonal line on the cylindrical surface. After the paper is unwrapped, the diagonal line will no longer remain straight but will transform into a curve due to the unrolling of the cylindrical surface.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Unrolling the cylinder\nWhen the cylindrical surface is unrolled, it becomes a rectangle (the original shape of the paper). The diagonal cut \\(X \\to Y\\), which was a straight line on the cylinder, will appear as a sinusoidal curve on the unrolled rectangle because the curved surface of the cylinder distorts the straight cut when flattened.\n\nThe sinusoidal curve will:\n- Start at \\(X\\) (bottom edge of the rectangle).\n- Peak somewhere along the length of the rectangle.\n- End at \\(Y\\) (top edge of the rectangle).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the correct shape\nFrom the given options, we need to look for a shape that matches the unrolled result. Among the choices:\n\n- **Option A:** A triangular shape is incorrect because it does not represent the sinusoidal curve that the cut would form.\n- **Option B:** A semicircular shape is incorrect because the curve would not be a perfect semicircle.\n- **Option C:** A sinusoidal curve is correct because the unrolling of the diagonal cut from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\) produces this shape.\n- **Option D:** A shape with a single peak is incorrect because it oversimplifies the sinusoidal nature of the curve.\n- **Option E:** A triangular shape is again incorrect for the same reason as Option A.\n\nThus, **Option C** is the correct choice.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",

To maximize the topmost cube, we want to maximize the numbers written on the second layer.\n\nThe second layer has 4 cubes, and their numbers are:\n\n\\[\nb_1 = a_1 + a_2 + a_4 + a_5, \\quad\nb_2 = a_2 + a_3 + a_5 + a_6,\n\\]\n\\[\nb_3 = a_4 + a_5 + a_7 + a_8, \\quad\nb_4 = a_5 + a_6 + a_8 + a_9.\n\\]\n\nThe total sum of all cubes in the second layer is:\n\n\\[\nS_{\\text{second}} = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4\\), we find:\n\n\\[\nS_{\\text{second}} = (a_1 + a_2 + a_4 + a_5) + (a_2 + a_3 + a_5 + a_6) + (a_4 + a_5 + a_7 + a_8) + (a_5 + a_6 + a_8 + a_9).\n\\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n\\[\nS_{\\text{second}} = 4a_5 + 2(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9).\n\\]\n\nSince \\(S_{\\text{bottom}} = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_9 = 50\\), we substitute:\n\n\\[\nS_{\\text{second}} = 4a_5 + 2(50 - a_5) = 100 + 2a_5.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Topmost Cube**\nThe number on the topmost cube is the sum of the numbers on the four cubes directly beneath it. Let the number on the topmost cube be \\(T\\):\n\n\\[\nT = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4.\n\\]\n\nFrom Step 3, we know:\n\n\\[\nT = S_{\\text{second}} = 100 + 2a_5.\n\\]\n\nTo maximize \\(T\\), we maximize \\(a_5\\), since \\(a_5\\) appears with the highest coefficient in the second layer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Maximizing \\(a_5\\)**\nTo maximize \\(a_5\\), we distribute the sum \\(S_{\\text{bottom}} = 50\\) among \\(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_9\\) while keeping them as distinct positive integers. The best way to maximize \\(a_5\\) is to minimize the other numbers while ensuring they remain distinct. \n\nThe smallest distinct positive integers are \\(1, 2, 3, \\dots\\). Assign these to the other eight cubes, leaving \\(a_5\\) to take the remaining sum:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36.\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\na_5 = 50 - 36 = 14.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculate the Topmost Cube**\nSubstitute \\(a_5 = 14\\) into the formula for \\(T\\):\n\n\\[\nT = 100 + 2a_5 = 100 + 2(14) = 100 + 28 = 128.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe biggest number that can be written on the topmost cube is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{128}\n\\]",

This means the total number of cubes in the entire brick is:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Outer Layer of Red Cubes\nThe outer layer of the brick is completely red. The red layer forms a \"shell\" around the brick. To calculate the number of red cubes, we subtract the dimensions of the inner blue cube from the total dimensions of the brick.\n\nThe inner blue cube is formed by removing the outer layer.

To calculate the volume of the brick covered by this outer layer, we remove the inner blue core.

We are focusing on pairs of kangaroos that can look into each other's eyes and swap places.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating Total Possible Swaps\nEach kangaroo has a fixed number of neighbors it can potentially swap with. Since we iterate through the swaps until no further swaps are possible, the total number of swaps is determined by the total number of adjacent pairs.\n\nIn a row of \\( n \\) kangaroos, there are \\( n - 1 \\) adjacent pairs.

    "solution": "Note that we want the path drawn out by the lasers to come back to $P$ in as few steps as possible. Observe that if a laser is fired with an angle of $n$ degrees from the tangent, then the number of points it creates on the circle is $\\frac{180}{\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)}$. (Consider the regular polygon created by linking all the points that show up on the circle-if the center of the circle is $\\mathrm{O}$, and the vertices are numbered $V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_k$, the angle $\\angle V_1 O V_2$ is equal to $2 \\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)$, so there are a total of $\\frac{360}{2 \\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)}$ sides).\\nNow, we consider the case with both $n$ and $n+1$. Note that we wish to minimize the value $\\frac{180}{\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)}+$ $\\frac{180}{\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n+1)}$, or maximize both $\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n+1)$.

This occurs when $n=80$. Plugging this into our expression, we have that the number of points that show up from the laser fired at 80 degrees is $\\frac{180}{20}=9$ and the number of points that appear from the laser fired at 81 degrees is $\\frac{180}{9}=20$.

Each laser beam reflects off the walls following the law of reflection.\n\nThe key observation here is that the path of the laser beams can be analyzed using **angles and periodicity** in a polygonal path. The laser beams return to \\( P \\) after completing a certain number of reflections, forming a closed path. The number of unique illuminated points corresponds to the number of reflections before the beams return to \\( P \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Reflections and periodicity\nFor a laser beam emitted at an angle \\( \\theta \\) with respect to the tangent, the points of intersection of the beam with the wall can be analyzed using modular arithmetic over a **circle of 360 degrees**.\n\n#### First beam:\nThe first beam is emitted at an angle \\( n^\\circ \\).

The angles of incidence and reflection are equal at each bounce. For a laser beam to return to its starting point \\(P\\), the total angular displacement after a certain number of reflections must be a multiple of \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Angular Displacement for Each Laser\nAt each reflection, the laser beam moves by twice the angle it makes with the tangent at \\(P\\). For a laser with an initial angle of \\(n^\\circ\\) with the tangent:\n\n- The angular displacement per reflection is \\(2n^\\circ\\) for the first laser.\n- The angular displacement per reflection is \\(2(n+1)^\\circ\\) for the second laser.\n\nThe total angular displacement for each laser beam after several reflections must be a multiple of \\(360^\\circ\\) for it to return to \\(P\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Least Common Multiple of Angular Displacements\nTo determine the minimum number of illuminated points, we need to calculate the least number of reflections required for both lasers to return to \\(P\\). This corresponds to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the angular displacements:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM of } 2n \\text{ and } 2(n+1).\n\\]\n\nThe LCM of \\(2n\\) and \\(2(n+1)\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(2n, 2(n+1)) = 2 \\cdot \\text{LCM}(n, n+1).\n\\]\n\nSince \\(n\\) and \\(n+1\\) are consecutive integers, they are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).

The key is to determine the minimum number of distinct points illuminated on the walls.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Reflection Pattern\nWhen a laser reflects off the walls, it continues traveling at the same angle relative to the tangent at the point of reflection. The circular room's symmetry ensures that the laser paths are periodic, meaning the laser eventually returns to the starting point \\(P\\).\n\n### Step 2: Angular Difference Between the Two Lasers\nThe angles at which the lasers are emitted are \\(n^\\circ\\) and \\((n+1)^\\circ\\) relative to the tangent at \\(P\\). The difference in angles between the two lasers is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\theta = (n+1)^\\circ - n^\\circ = 1^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Number of Distinct Points Illuminated\nEach laser reflects repeatedly, and the number of distinct points it illuminates before returning to \\(P\\) depends on the angle of incidence. Specifically, the number of distinct points illuminated by a laser is determined by the least number of reflections required for the laser path to \"close\" (return to \\(P\\)).\n\nFor a laser emitted at an angle \\(\\theta\\), the number of distinct points illuminated is related to the denominator of \\(\\theta / 360^\\circ\\) in its simplest fractional form.

For the two lasers to minimize the total number of distinct illuminated points, their paths must overlap as much as possible. This occurs when their angular difference, \\(\\Delta \\theta = 1^\\circ\\), results in a shared periodic structure.\n\nThe minimum number of distinct illuminated points is the least common multiple (\\(\\text{lcm}\\)) of the number of reflections required for each laser to return to \\(P\\).

A key observation is that \\(\\gcd(360, n)\\) and \\(\\gcd(360, n+1)\\) should share many common factors for the \\(\\text{lcm}\\) to be small.\n\nThe smallest value occurs when \\(n = 89\\):\n- For \\(n = 89\\), \\(\\gcd(360, 89) = 1\\) and \\(\\gcd(360, 90) = 90\\).\n- The number of reflections for the two lasers are:\n  - Laser 1: \\( \\frac{360}{1} = 360 \\),\n  - Laser 2: \\( \\frac{360}{90} = 4 \\).\n\nThus, the total number of distinct points is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{lcm}(360, 4) = 360.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{360}\n\\]",

The lasers reflect off the perfectly reflective walls of a circular room, eventually returning to \\( P \\).\n3. The task is to determine the minimum number of illuminated points on the walls of the room.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze reflections in a circular room\nWhen a point \\( P \\) is on the boundary of a circular room, the behavior of the lasers can be studied using **angles of incidence and reflection**. The lasers travel along straight paths between reflections, and at each reflection, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Using the property of periodicity\n- Let the circle have a circumference represented as \\( 360^\\circ \\) (in angular terms).\n- Each laser beam starts at \\( P \\), and its trajectory can be described by its angular increment per reflection:\n  - For the first laser, the angular increment is \\( 2n^\\circ \\) (since the beam enters at \\( n^\\circ \\) relative to the tangent and leaves symmetrically).\n  - For the second laser, the angular increment is \\( 2(n+1)^\\circ \\).\n\nThe laser beams will continue reflecting until they return to \\( P \\). The key to solving the problem lies in determining the number of distinct illuminated points on the wall \u2014 this depends on the periodicity of the angular increments.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Determine when lasers return to \\( P \\)\nThe lasers return to \\( P \\) after a full rotation (i.e., an angular displacement of \\( 360^\\circ \\)). This happens when the angular increment multiplied by the number of reflections equals a multiple of \\( 360^\\circ \\). Therefore:\n- For the first laser: \\( k \\cdot 2n = 360m \\), where \\( k \\) and \\( m \\) are integers.\n- For the second laser: \\( l \\cdot 2(n+1) = 360p \\), where \\( l \\) and \\( p \\) are integers.\n\nThe **least common multiple (LCM)** of these angular increments determines the number of distinct illuminated points.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Find the minimum number of distinct points\n1. The angular increments are \\( 2n \\) and \\( 2(n+1) \\).\n2. Since \\( 2 \\) is a common factor, we can simplify this to finding the LCM of \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\).\n3. \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\) are consecutive integers, so their greatest common divisor (GCD) is \\( 1 \\). Therefore, their LCM is \\( n(n+1) \\).\n\nThis LCM represents the number of distinct illuminated points. However, not all these points are necessarily unique across both lasers. To minimize the total number of illuminated points, we consider the overlap of points illuminated by both lasers.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Solve for minimum \\( n \\)\nTo minimize the number of illuminated points:\n- \\( n(n+1) \\) must be as small as possible.\n- The smallest \\( n \\) is \\( 1 \\), but this produces \\( n(n+1) = 2 \\), which is invalid because the lasers must travel at least \\( 360^\\circ \\).\n- For \\( n = 2 \\), \\( n(n+1) = 6 \\).

The graph is connected.\n\nHere:\n- Island 1 and Island 2 each have odd degrees (\\( 3 \\)), while \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) have even degrees (\\( 2 \\)).\n- The graph is connected because all vertices are connected via bridges.\n\nThus, an Eulerian path exists.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Possible Paths\nTo find the exact number of Eulerian paths, we note:\n1. The Eulerian path must start at one vertex of odd degree (Island 1 or Island 2) and end at the other vertex of odd degree.\n2. The number of possible distinct paths can be determined using combinatorial methods or systematic enumeration of all possibilities.\n\nBy manually enumerating all paths:\n- There are exactly **8 distinct Eulerian paths** satisfying the conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",

The graph is connected.\n2. Exactly 0 or 2 vertices have odd degrees.\n\nIn this problem:\n- All vertices (\\(A, B, C, D\\)) have even degrees.\n- The graph is connected (all vertices are reachable from each other).\n\nSince all vertices have even degrees, the graph has an **Eulerian circuit** (a closed Eulerian path), meaning it is possible to traverse each bridge exactly once and return to the starting point.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of distinct Eulerian circuits\n\nThe number of distinct Eulerian circuits in a graph can be determined using advanced combinatorial techniques. However, for small graphs like this one, we can manually enumerate all possible paths.\n\n1. Start at \\(A\\).\n2. Traverse all six bridges exactly once, returning to \\(B\\).\n\nBy systematically listing all possibilities or applying known results, it can be shown that there are exactly \\(\\boxed{8}\\) distinct Eulerian paths satisfying the conditions.",

    "response_0": "### Problem Analysis\nThe problem involves a beam of light reflecting multiple times between the two segments \\( \\overline{AB} \\) and \\( \\overline{BC} \\). The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection at each bounce. The goal is to determine the total number of reflections until the beam exits the triangle, starting with the first reflection at \\( C \\).\n\nKey observations:\n1. The triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is isosceles since \\( AB = AC \\).\n2. The angles at \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) can be calculated using the given information.\n3. The path of the light beam can be tracked geometrically using the law of reflection.\n\n### Step 1: Geometry of Triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\)\n- \\( \\beta = \\frac{\\alpha}{10} = 1.994^\\circ \\).\n- At vertex \\( B \\), the angle \\( \\angle ABC = \\beta = 1.994^\\circ \\).\n- Since \\( AB = AC \\), \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is isosceles, so \\( \\angle BAC = \\angle ACB \\).\n- The sum of the angles in a triangle is \\( 180^\\circ \\). Therefore:\n  \\[\n  \\angle BAC + \\angle ACB + \\angle ABC = 180^\\circ,\n  \\]\n  and since \\( \\angle BAC = \\angle ACB \\),\n  \\[\n  2\\angle BAC + \\beta = 180^\\circ.\n  \\]\n  Substituting \\( \\beta = 1.994^\\circ \\):\n  \\[\n  2\\angle BAC + 1.994^\\circ = 180^\\circ,\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  2\\angle BAC = 178.006^\\circ,\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\angle BAC = \\angle ACB = 89.003^\\circ.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Path of the Light Beam\n- The beam starts at \\( C \\), where it reflects with an angle of incidence \\( \\alpha = 19.94^\\circ \\).\n- After reflecting at \\( C \\), the beam proceeds toward \\( AB \\).\n- At \\( AB \\), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\n- The beam continues to reflect alternately between \\( \\overline{AB} \\) and \\( \\overline{BC} \\).\n\nKey insight: After each reflection, the beam \"climbs\" closer to the vertex \\( B \\). The reflection process will terminate when the beam exits the triangle through one of the sides.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Reflections\nThe light beam bounces off the two sides in a predictable pattern:\n1. At each reflection, the beam shifts slightly closer to \\( B \\).\n2. The total number of reflections depends on the geometry of the triangle and the initial angle of incidence.\n\nThe key to solving this is to determine how many reflections the beam undergoes before it exits the triangle. Using the geometry and angles given:\n- The beam will reflect **10 times** in total. This includes the first reflection at \\( C \\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",

Thus, we find \\( \\angle ABC \\):\n\\[\n\\angle ABC = 180^\\circ - \\angle BCA - \\angle CAB = 180^\\circ - \\beta - \\beta = 180^\\circ - 2\\beta.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( \\beta = 1.994^\\circ \\):\n\\[\n\\angle ABC = 180^\\circ - 2(1.994^\\circ) = 180^\\circ - 3.988^\\circ = 176.012^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Path of the Light Beam\nThe light beam reflects off \\( \\overline{BC} \\) at point \\( C \\) with angle of incidence \\( \\alpha = 19.94^\\circ \\). After each reflection, it follows the law of reflection and remains within \\( \\triangle ABC \\) unless it exits the triangle.\n\n#### Reflection off \\( \\overline{AB} \\) and \\( \\overline{BC} \\)\nEach reflection changes the direction of the light beam. To determine when the beam exits the triangle, we analyze the cumulative angular change due to reflections. The light beam will exit the triangle when its cumulative angular deviation causes it to no longer strike either \\( \\overline{AB} \\) or \\( \\overline{BC} \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Total Angular Deviation Per Reflection\nThe light beam reflects off \\( \\overline{BC} \\) and \\( \\overline{AB} \\), and we calculate how much the beam's angular deviation accumulates after each reflection.\n\n- At \\( \\overline{BC} \\), the angle of reflection relative to \\( \\overline{BC} \\) is \\( \\alpha \\).\n- At \\( \\overline{AB} \\), the angle of incidence is altered by the internal angles of \\( \\triangle ABC \\), specifically \\( \\beta \\).\n\nEach complete cycle of reflection (from \\( \\overline{BC} \\) to \\( \\overline{AB} \\) and back) results in a cumulative angular deviation of \\( 2\\beta \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Total Number of Reflections\nThe light beam begins at \\( \\overline{BC} \\) and continues reflecting until the cumulative angular deviation sums to \\( 180^\\circ \\), which causes the beam to exit the triangle.\n\nWe calculate the number of reflections required to reach \\( 180^\\circ \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Number of reflections} = \\frac{180^\\circ}{2\\beta}.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( \\beta = 1.994^\\circ \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Number of reflections} = \\frac{180^\\circ}{2(1.994^\\circ)} = \\frac{180^\\circ}{3.988^\\circ} \\approx 45.16.\n\\]\n\nSince the number of reflections must be an integer, we round down to \\( 45 \\), as the beam exits the triangle on the \\( 45^\\text{th} \\) reflection.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Including the First Reflection\nThe first reflection at \\( C \\) is included in the total count.

The beam will keep reflecting until the cumulative angular shift causes the beam to exit the triangle. This happens when the total angular shift reaches \\(180^\\circ\\), at which point the beam exits through one of the sides.\n\nThe number of full cycles of reflections is:\n\\[\nN_{\\text{cycles}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{180^\\circ}{\\Delta} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{180^\\circ}{21.934^\\circ} \\right\\rfloor = 8.\n\\]\n\nEach cycle contains 2 reflections (one on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) and one on \\(\\overline{BC}\\)).

      "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct paths from the top-left corner (January 1) to the bottom-right corner (December 31) in the given grid. Each step can move to the right, down, or diagonally down to the right.\n\nThis is a combinatorics problem, and we will use a dynamic programming approach to count the paths.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the grid structure\nThe grid has 6 rows and 6 columns, forming a \\(5 \\times 5\\) square. The number of dots in each row and column is \\(6\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Define the rules\nLet \\(P(i, j)\\) represent the number of ways to reach the dot in row \\(i\\) and column \\(j\\). We initialize \\(P(1, 1) = 1\\) because there is only one way to start at the top-left corner.\n\nThe general rule to compute \\(P(i, j)\\) is as follows:\n\\[\nP(i, j) = P(i-1, j) + P(i, j-1) + P(i-1, j-1)\n\\]\nThis formula is derived from the fact that a dot \\((i, j)\\) can be reached from:\n1. The dot directly above it, \\((i-1, j)\\),\n2. The dot directly to the left of it, \\((i, j-1)\\),\n3. The dot diagonally above it, \\((i-1, j-1)\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Build a table using dynamic programming\nWe will compute \\(P(i, j)\\) row by row, starting from \\(P(1, 1)\\) and filling in the table until \\(P(6, 6)\\).\n\n#### Initialize the table\n- For the first row (\\(i = 1\\)), all dots can only be reached by moving to the right. Thus:\n\\[\nP(1, j) = 1 \\quad \\text{for } j = 1, 2, \\dots, 6.\n\\]\n- For the first column (\\(j = 1\\)), all dots can only be reached by moving down. Thus:\n\\[\nP(i, 1) = 1 \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, 2, \\dots, 6.\n\\]\n\n#### Fill in the table\nUsing the formula \\(P(i, j) = P(i-1, j) + P(i, j-1) + P(i-1, j-1)\\), we compute the values step by step.\n\n| \\(i, j\\) | \\(P(i, j)\\) |\n|----------|-------------|\n| \\(2, 2\\) |",

The arrow initially points upward, and we are tasked with finding when it next points upward again.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understanding rotation and rolling\n#### (a) Circumference of the smaller disk and the larger clock face\n- The circumference of the larger clock face is:\n  \\[\n  C_{\\text{large}} = 2 \\pi R = 2 \\pi (20) = 40\\pi \\, \\text{cm}.\n  \\]\n- The circumference of the smaller disk is:\n  \\[\n  C_{\\text{small}} = 2 \\pi r = 2 \\pi (10) = 20\\pi \\, \\text{cm}.\n  \\]\n\n#### (b) How far the smaller disk rolls before the arrow points upward again\nThe arrow on the smaller disk completes one full rotation when it rolls a distance equal to the circumference of the smaller disk, \\( 20\\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\). Therefore, the smaller disk completes one full rotation for every \\( 20\\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\) of arc length rolled along the larger clock face.\n\nHowever, the smaller disk does not only rotate due to its rolling. Because it is rolling around the larger clock face, it also rotates due to the curvature of the larger clock face. This additional rotation must be accounted for.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Total rotation of the smaller disk\nThe smaller disk makes two types of rotations:\n1. **Intrinsic rotation due to rolling:** As the smaller disk rolls a distance equal to the circumference of the larger clock face (\\( 40\\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\)), it completes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Intrinsic rotations} = \\frac{40\\pi}{20\\pi} = 2 \\, \\text{full rotations}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rotation due to the curvature of the larger clock face:** As the smaller disk rolls around the larger circle, it also rotates once for every revolution around the larger clock face. Since the smaller disk completes one full revolution around the clock face, it rotates an additional \\( 1 \\, \\text{full rotation} \\).\n\nThus, the total rotation of the smaller disk after one complete revolution around the clock face is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total rotations} = \\text{Intrinsic rotations} + \\text{Curvature-induced rotations} = 2 + 1 = 3 \\, \\text{full rotations}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Determining when the arrow points upward again\nFor the arrow to point upward again, the smaller disk must complete an integer number of full rotations. Since the smaller disk completes 3 full rotations after rolling once around the clock face, the arrow will point upward again when the disk is tangent to the clock face at its initial position (\\( 12 \\, \\text{o'clock} \\)).\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the first time the arrow points upward again **before completing a full revolution**. To find this, we calculate how far the disk needs to roll to complete 1 full rotation of the arrow.\n\n#### (a) Distance rolled for 1 full rotation\nThe smaller disk completes one full rotation when it rolls a distance equal to its own circumference, \\( 20\\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\n#### (b) Arc length on the larger clock face\nThe arc length rolled on the larger clock face corresponds to the distance the smaller disk rolls. Since the smaller disk rolls \\( 20\\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\), the corresponding angle subtended at the center of the larger clock face is:\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{\\text{Arc length}}{\\text{Radius}} = \\frac{20\\pi}{20} = \\pi \\, \\text{radians}.\n\\]\n\n#### (c) Conversion to clock positions\nAn angle of \\( \\pi \\, \\text{radians} \\) corresponds to half the circumference of the larger clock face, which is equivalent to moving from \\( 12 \\, \\text{o'clock} \\) to \\( 6 \\, \\text{o'clock} \\).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nThe smaller disk will be tangent to the larger clock face at \\( \\boxed{\\text{6 o'clock}} \\) when the arrow is next pointing in the upward vertical direction.",

The arrow on the smaller disk rotates as the disk rolls, and we must determine at which point on the clock face the smaller disk is tangent when the arrow points vertically upward again.\n\n### Step 2: Total rotation of the smaller disk\nWhen the smaller disk rolls around the larger clock face, it undergoes two types of rotations:\n1. A **rotation due to rolling**: The smaller disk rotates one full revolution for each circumference of the larger clock face it rolls around.\n2. A **rotation due to the center of the smaller disk traveling in a circular path**: The center of the smaller disk also moves around the larger circle, contributing additional rotation.\n\n#### Calculate the effective rotation:\n- Circumference of the larger clock face is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\pi \\cdot 20 = 40 \\pi \\, \\text{cm}.\n  \\]\n- Circumference of the smaller disk is:\n  \\[\n  2 \\pi \\cdot 10 = 20 \\pi \\, \\text{cm}.\n  \\]\n\nWhen the smaller disk rolls a distance of \\( 40 \\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\) (the circumference of the larger clock face), it completes:\n\\[\n\\frac{40 \\pi}{20 \\pi} = 2 \\, \\text{full rotations due to rolling}.\n\\]\n\nIn addition to this, there is an extra rotation caused by the center of the smaller disk traveling in a circular path.

The **center of the smaller disk** follows a circular path around the larger clock face. Since the radius of the larger circle is \\( 20 \\, \\text{cm} \\) and the radius of the smaller disk is \\( 10 \\, \\text{cm} \\), the center of the smaller disk traces a path with a radius of \\( 20 + 10 = 30 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n2.

For the arrow to return to this position, the smaller disk must rotate an integer number of full revolutions.

Both triangles are drawn to scale, and their shapes indicate that they are non-overlapping and separated.\n2. By inspecting the geometry, the line segments connecting certain vertex pairs will cross the interior of one of the triangles.\n\n#### Key insight:\n- If we carefully analyze the positions of the vertices and the triangles' shapes, **any line segment joining adjacent vertices across the triangles will cross one of the triangles.**\n- However, certain pairs of vertices that are farthest apart (e.g., \\( A \\) and \\( F \\)) will not cause the line to cross either triangle.\n\nThus, we need to systematically examine which pairs satisfy the condition.\n\n### Step 3: Valid pairs\n#### Case 1: Vertex \\( A \\) (from Triangle 1)\n- Pair \\( (A, D) \\): Line crosses Triangle 1 \u2192 Invalid.\n- Pair \\( (A, E) \\): Line crosses Triangle 1 \u2192 Invalid.\n- Pair \\( (A, F) \\): Line does not cross any triangle \u2192 Valid.\n\n#### Case 2: Vertex \\( B \\) (from Triangle 1)\n- Pair \\( (B, D) \\): Line crosses Triangle 1 \u2192 Invalid.\n- Pair \\( (B, E) \\): Line does not cross any triangle \u2192 Valid.\n- Pair \\( (B, F) \\): Line crosses Triangle 2 \u2192 Invalid.\n\n#### Case 3: Vertex \\( C \\) (from Triangle 1)\n- Pair \\( (C, D) \\): Line does not cross any triangle \u2192 Valid.\n- Pair \\( (C, E) \\): Line crosses Triangle 2 \u2192 Invalid.\n- Pair \\( (C, F) \\): Line crosses Triangle 2 \u2192 Invalid.\n\n### Step 4: Count the valid pairs\nFrom the analysis above, the valid pairs are:\n1. \\( (A, F) \\)\n2. \\( (B, E) \\)\n3. \\( (C, D) \\)\n\nThus, there are **3 valid pairs**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

Therefore, the ant alternates between the outer and inner cycles in consecutive steps.\n\n3. **Parity of steps**:\n   - At even-numbered steps (e.g., step 0, 2, 4, etc.), the ant will be on the outer cycle.\n   - At odd-numbered steps (e.g., step 1, 3, 5, etc.), the ant will be on the inner cycle.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze \\( 2019 \\) minutes\n- After \\( 2019 \\) minutes, the ant will have taken \\( 2019 \\) steps.\n- Since \\( 2019 \\) is odd, the ant will be on the **inner cycle** of the graph after \\( 2019 \\) minutes.\n\n### Step 4: Possible vertices\n- On the inner cycle, the vertices are labeled \\( P, Q, R, S, \\) and 4 others.\n- As the ant can move freely between vertices on the inner cycle, it is possible for the ant to reach any of the inner vertices after \\( 2019 \\) steps.\n\nThus, the ant can be at \\( P, Q, R, S \\), or any other vertex in the inner cycle. However, it **cannot** be at \\( T \\), which is on the outer cycle, because \\( 2019 \\) is odd.\n\n### Step 5: Eliminate options\n- **Option A**: \"Only \\( P, R, S \\)\" \u2014 Incorrect, as \\( Q \\) is also reachable.\n- **Option B**: \"Not \\( Q \\)\" \u2014 Incorrect, as \\( Q \\) is reachable.\n- **Option C**: \"Only \\( Q \\)\" \u2014 Incorrect, as other inner-cycle vertices (\\( P, R, S \\)) are also reachable.\n- **Option D**: \"Only \\( T \\)\" \u2014 Incorrect, as \\( T \\) is on the outer cycle and cannot be reached at an odd step.\n- **Option E**: \"All of the vertices are possible\" \u2014 Incorrect, as \\( T \\) is not reachable.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{A}}\n\\]",
    "response_7": "To solve the problem, we need to determine which vertices the ant can visit after 2019 minutes. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the graph structure.\nThe graph is composed of:\n1. An **outer cycle** with 8 vertices.\n2. An **inner cycle** with 4 vertices.\n3. Connecting edges between the outer and inner cycles.\n\nThe vertices labeled \\(P, Q, R, S, T\\) are spread across the graph:\n- \\(P, Q, R, S\\) are part of the **inner cycle**.\n- \\(T\\) is on the **outer cycle**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: The behavior of the ant.\nThe ant begins at the vertex labeled \"Start\" on the outer cycle. Every minute, the ant moves to an adjacent vertex. Therefore, it can travel along the graph's edges, either staying on the outer cycle, moving to the inner cycle, or moving back to the outer cycle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Key observation \u2014 Parity of the number of moves.\nEach move changes the ant's position, and the ant alternates between vertices of **even parity** (number of edges traveled is even) and **odd parity** (number of edges traveled is odd). \n\n- After \\(n\\) moves:\n  - The ant is at a vertex of **even parity** if \\(n\\) is even.\n  - The ant is at a vertex of **odd parity** if \\(n\\) is odd.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Check the parity of 2019.\nThe number 2019 is odd. This means that after 2019 moves, the ant will be at a vertex of **odd parity**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Determine the parities of the vertices.\n1. The \"Start\" vertex has **even parity** (it is the starting point, \\(0\\) moves).\n2. The parity alternates as the ant moves along the graph:\n   - Moving along the **outer cycle** alternates parity.\n   - Moving to the **inner cycle** also changes parity.\n\nThus:\n- The vertices \\(P, Q, R, S\\) in the **inner cycle** have **odd parity**.\n- The vertex \\(T\\) in the **outer cycle** has **even parity**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Vertices reachable after 2019 minutes.\nSince 2019 is odd, the ant can only be at vertices of **odd parity**. These are:\n- \\(P, Q, R, S\\).\n\nThe ant **cannot** be at \\(T\\), as \\(T\\) has even parity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{A}}\n\\]\nOnly \\(P, R, S\\) are reachable.",

Solving the Path:\nTo determine the direction Monika must move at \\(x\\), we must trace a valid path through the labyrinth that satisfies the rules.\n\n#### 3.1. Key Observations:\n- Monika starts at the leftmost white circle in the **top row**.\n- She must navigate through the labyrinth in such a way that all white circles are visited exactly once.\n- The black circles restrict her movement and influence the path.\n\n#### 3.2. Trace the Path:\nWe will trace the path step by step from \"Start\" to \\(x\\), ensuring all white circles are visited once and black circles are avoided.\n\n1. **First Row:**\n   - Move right through all white circles to the last white circle in the row.\n\n2. **Second Row:**\n   - Drop down to the second row and move left through all white circles to the first circle in the row.\n\n3. **Third Row:**\n   - Drop down to the third row and move right through all white circles to the last circle in the row.\n\n4. **Fourth Row:**\n   - Drop down to the fourth row and move left through the first three white circles.\n   - From the fourth circle in the row, move down to the circle marked \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Determining the Direction at \\(x\\):\nWhen Monika reaches \\(x\\), she needs to move **right** to continue visiting the remaining white circles. This ensures she can complete the path without revisiting any circle or stepping on a black circle.\n\n---\n\n#### 5.

Monika must navigate the white circles.\n- \\(x\\) is located in the fourth row and the fifth column.\n- Monika must pass through \\(x\\) while adhering to the rules.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand path constraints.\n- Monika cannot revisit any white circle. Therefore, the path must use each white circle exactly once.\n- Black circles block the path, so Monika must navigate around them.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Trace Monika's path logically.\n1. Starting at \"Start,\" Monika must move to the right along the top row until she reaches the first black circle in the third column.\n2. From there, she moves down into the second row to avoid the black circle.\n3. She continues moving right until she reaches the black circle in the sixth column.\n4. To avoid the sixth-column black circle, Monika moves down to the third row and continues leftward.\n5.

It avoids black circles.\n  2.

She must enter every white circle exactly once.\n3. She cannot enter any black circle.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the direction Monika must move when she reaches the circle marked with \\(x\\). Let us solve this step by step:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the layout of the labyrinth**\n- The labyrinth is a grid with white circles (allowed to visit) and black circles (not allowed to visit).\n- Monika starts at the 'Start' position (leftmost white circle in the top row) and moves towards 'Ziel' (rightmost white circle in the top row).\n- She must visit every white circle exactly once, which means her path cannot overlap or skip any white circle.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the circle marked \\(x\\)**\n- The circle marked with \\(x\\) is in the fourth row and the fifth column (counting from the top-left corner of the grid).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the path through the labyrinth**\n- Monika must carefully navigate the grid to visit each white circle exactly once, avoiding black circles. To determine the correct path:\n  1. Start from the 'Start' position in the top-left corner.\n  2. Follow the path row by row, avoiding black circles and ensuring every white circle is visited exactly once.\n  3. Keep track of how Monika moves as she reaches the circle marked \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Trace the path leading to the circle \\(x\\)**\n- Monika will follow this path:\n  1. Move right along the top row to the end, stopping at the last white circle.\n  2. Move down to the second row, then move left along the second row to the start.\n  3. Move down to the third row, then move right along the third row to the end.\n  4. Move down to the fourth row, then move left along the fourth row until reaching the circle \\(x\\).\n\nThus, Monika reaches \\(x\\) by moving left along the fourth row.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the next move from \\(x\\)**\n- At \\(x\\), the only unvisited white circle adjacent to her is directly below \\(x\\) (in the fifth row, same column). Therefore, Monika must move **downwards** (\\(\\downarrow\\)) from \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Conclude the solution**\nThe correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",

Each vertex in the diagram has an **even degree** (number of edges connected to it), except \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), which have an **odd degree**.\n   - \\( A \\): Degree 1 (1 edge connected).\n   - \\( B \\): Degree 1 (1 edge connected).\n   - All other vertices: Degree 4.\n   \n2. Since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are the only vertices with an odd degree, it is possible to construct a path that starts at \\( A \\) and ends at \\( B \\). This path can traverse all edges of the graph except one.\n\n#### Step 3.2: Total edges traversed\nSince the park has 9 edges in total, Anna can traverse 8 of these edges in her longest path. The one unused edge is necessary because she must stop at \\( B \\) without retracing any edges.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total length\nEach path is \\( 100 \\, \\text{m} \\) long, and Anna can traverse 8 paths. Therefore, the total length of the longest path is:\n\n\\[\n8 \\times 100 \\, \\text{m} = 800 \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe longest path Anna can choose is \\( 800 \\, \\text{m} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",
    "response_4": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the longest path Anna can walk from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) without using the same path twice. Each path is 100 meters long, and the maximum distance Anna can walk corresponds to traversing as many unique paths as possible.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the park\nThe diagram is a triangular arrangement of paths. It consists of:\n- **9 edges (paths)**, each 100 meters long.\n\nThe vertices are \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and five other points. Anna must walk from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\), traversing paths without repetition.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Longest path problem\nTo maximize the length of the walk, Anna should attempt to traverse as many of the 9 paths as possible, ending at \\( B \\). In graph-theoretic terms, this is a \"Hamiltonian path\" problem, where we want the longest path that visits edges without repetition.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine the path\nAnna can follow the following sequence of paths to traverse 8 of the 9 edges:\n1. Start at \\( A \\),\n2. Traverse the paths systematically to cover as many edges as possible without repetition,\n3. End at \\( B \\).\n\nOne possible longest path that satisfies the conditions is:\n\n\\[\nA \\to \\text{lower left} \\to \\text{middle left} \\to \\text{middle center} \\to \\text{top} \\to \\text{middle right} \\to \\text{lower right} \\to \\text{middle bottom} \\to B.\n\\]\n\nThis path uses **8 edges**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total distance\nEach path is 100 meters long. Since Anna traverses 8 edges, the total distance is:\n\n\\[\n8 \\times 100 = 800 \\, \\text{meters}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Verify the answer\nIt is impossible to traverse all 9 paths because Anna must avoid revisiting any paths, and the graph's structure prevents her from using all paths while ending at \\( B \\).\n\nThus, the longest path Anna can walk from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) is **800 meters**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",
    "response_5": "To solve the problem step by step, let us analyze the situation:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the park\nThe park is represented as a graph. Each of the 9 paths has a length of \\(100 \\, \\mathrm{m}\\). The graph forms a triangular lattice, with the following key properties:\n1. The vertices of the graph are labeled \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and intermediate points.\n2. The edges represent paths between these points.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Objective of the problem\nAnna wants to walk the **longest possible path** from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) without using the same path twice. This means we are looking for the **longest path in the graph** that starts at \\(A\\) and ends at \\(B\\), traversing each edge at most once.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the graph\nThe graph is composed of 9 paths. Since each path is \\(100 \\, \\mathrm{m}\\), the total length of all paths is:\n\\[\n9 \\times 100 = 900 \\, \\mathrm{m}.\n\\]\n\nAnna cannot use all 9 paths because she must start at \\(A\\) and end at \\(B\\). Instead, the longest path she can take from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is determined by the structure of the graph.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Longest possible path from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\)\nTo maximize the path length, Anna should:\n1. Start at \\(A\\).\n2. Traverse as many paths as possible without retracing any edge.\n3. End at \\(B\\).\n\nThe longest path from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) involves **8 edges**:\n- Start at \\(A\\), traverse through the entire graph, and eventually reach \\(B\\), leaving out only the edge directly connecting \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Length of the longest path\nThe longest path uses 8 edges, and each edge is \\(100 \\, \\mathrm{m}\\). Therefore:\n\\[\n\\text{Longest path length} = 8 \\times 100 = 800 \\, \\mathrm{m}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",

We need to determine the maximum possible length of such a path.\n\n### Step 2: Count the total number of paths\nThe park consists of \\( 9 \\) paths, each \\( 100 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\) long. Therefore, the total distance of all paths is:\n\n\\[\n9 \\times 100 = 900 \\, \\mathrm{m}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the structure of the graph\nThe graph forms a triangular lattice with vertices connected by edges. Each vertex has an even degree except for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), which have odd degrees. This indicates that the graph is semi-Eulerian, meaning it has an Eulerian path (a path that traverses each edge exactly once) starting at \\( A \\) and ending at \\( B \\).\n\n### Step 4: Find the longest path\nThe longest path Anna can take is an Eulerian path because:\n- She must start at \\( A \\) and end at \\( B \\).\n- She can traverse every edge exactly once.\n\nThe total length of an Eulerian path is equal to the total length of all edges, which is \\( 900 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\).\n\n### Step 5: Verify the conditions\n- Anna can traverse all \\( 9 \\) paths without repeating any path.\n- She starts at \\( A \\) and ends at \\( B \\), satisfying the conditions of the problem.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",

Each path is \\( 100 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\), and there are \\( 9 \\) paths in total.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the paths\nThe park's layout is a triangular grid with:\n- \\( A \\) at the bottom-right corner.\n- \\( B \\) at the top vertex.\n\nThe diagram shows 9 paths forming a triangular arrangement. Each path is \\( 100 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Key concept: Eulerian paths\nAn **Eulerian path** is a path that visits each edge exactly once. A graph has an Eulerian path if:\n1. At most two vertices have an odd degree (number of edges connected to the vertex).\n2. All edges are connected.\n\nIn this graph:\n- Vertex \\( A \\) has degree 2 (connected to 2 edges).\n- Vertex \\( B \\) has degree 2.\n- All other vertices have degree 4 (connected to 4 edges).\n\nSince the graph meets the conditions for an Eulerian path (at most two vertices with odd degrees), Anna can traverse all the edges exactly once.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of edges traversed\nThere are \\( 9 \\) edges in total, and each edge is \\( 100 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\).
