This is a typical \\( S_N2 \\) reaction, where the nucleophile (\\( \\ce{Br-} \\)) displaces the leaving group (\\( \\ce{PPh3} \\)).\n\n2. **Mechanism of the \\( S_N2 \\) Reaction:**\n   - In an \\( S_N2 \\) reaction, the nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon from the opposite side of the leaving group. This results in the inversion of configuration at the carbon center and the departure of the leaving group.\n\n3. **Identify the Leaving Group:**\n   - The leaving group in this reaction is the triphenylphosphine group (\\( \\ce{PPh3} \\)), which will leave as a positively charged species (\\( \\ce{PPh3+} \\)).\n\n4. **Immediate Product:**\n   - After the \\( S_N2 \\) reaction, the carbon center will lose the \\( \\ce{PPh3} \\) group and gain a bromide ion (\\( \\ce{Br-} \\)). This results in the formation of a neutral product with two bromine atoms attached to the carbon.\n\n5. **Analyze the Options:**\n   - **Option A:** This shows a product with a double bond and the formation of \\( \\ce{O=PPh3} \\). This is not the immediate product of the \\( S_N2 \\) reaction.\n   - **Option B:** This shows \\( \\ce{Br2} \\) and a positively charged \\( \\ce{PPh3} \\) group. This is not consistent with the \\( S_N2 \\) mechanism.\n   - **Option C:** This shows a carbocation and a negatively charged \\( \\ce{CBr3} \\) group. This is not consistent with the \\( S_N2 \\) mechanism.\n   - **Option D:** This is the starting structure, not the product.\n\n### Correct Answer:\nThe immediate product of the \\( S_N2 \\) reaction is not explicitly shown in the options provided. However, based on the mechanism, the correct structure would involve the substitution of \\( \\ce{PPh3} \\) with \\( \\ce{Br-} \\), resulting in a neutral product with two bromine atoms attached to the carbon.\n\nIf the question asks for the immediate product of the next step, none of the options fully match the expected product.",

This results in a **lower equilibrium yield of ammonia** at \\(T_2\\) compared to \\(T_1\\).\n\nThus, the equilibrium yield of ammonia at \\(T_2\\) will be lower than at \\(T_1\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Effect of temperature on reaction rate\nHigher temperatures increase the kinetic energy of molecules, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions. This increases the **rate of reaction**, meaning the system will reach equilibrium faster at \\(T_2\\) than at \\(T_1\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the graphs\n- At \\(T_2 > T_1\\), the equilibrium yield of ammonia is lower, so the curve for \\(T_2\\) must level off at a lower percentage yield than \\(T_1\\).\n- The reaction at \\(T_2\\) reaches equilibrium faster, so the curve for \\(T_2\\) must rise more steeply than the curve for \\(T_1\\).\n\nFrom the given options:\n- **Option (C)** correctly shows that the curve for \\(T_2\\) rises faster but levels off at a lower yield compared to \\(T_1\\).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n\\]"

The functional group \\(-CONH-\\) is an amide group, and it is attached to two benzene rings.

It deactivates the benzene ring it is directly attached to and directs incoming electrophiles (like \\(-NO_2\\)) to the **meta position** relative to itself.\n- The other benzene ring (not directly attached to the amide group) is unaffected by the electron-withdrawing effects of the amide group.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the site of nitration\n- The benzene ring directly attached to the amide group will undergo nitration at the **meta position** because the amide group is a meta-directing group.\n- The other benzene ring is less reactive due to the absence of activating groups, so nitration is unlikely to occur there.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the major product\nThe nitro group will be introduced at the **meta position** of the benzene ring directly attached to the amide group.

The amide group is an electron-donating group (via resonance), and it activates the benzene ring to which it is attached, making it more reactive toward electrophilic substitution.
