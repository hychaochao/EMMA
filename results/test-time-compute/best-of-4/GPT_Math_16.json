The 3x3 grid has rotational and reflective symmetries. We will categorize the patterns into equivalence classes based on these symmetries.\n\n#### Case 1: Squares are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)\n- **Horizontal pairs**: There are **3 rows**, and each row has **2 horizontal pairs**. So there are \\(3 \\cdot 2 = 6\\) horizontal pairs.\n- **Vertical pairs**: There are **3 columns**, and each column has **2 vertical pairs**. So there are \\(3 \\cdot 2 = 6\\) vertical pairs.\n- **Diagonal pairs**: There are **2 diagonals**, and each diagonal has **2 possible pairs**.

To classify these, we consider their relative positions:\n\n- **Opposite corners**: There are 2 pairs of opposite corners in the grid (e.g., top-left & bottom-right, top-right & bottom-left).

The resulting parallelogram is symmetric, and its two parallel sides lie along the folds. The base of the parallelogram corresponds to the length of the diagonal (\\(10\\sqrt{5}\\)), while its height corresponds to the perpendicular distance from one fold to the other.\n\nWe now need to calculate the height of the parallelogram.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Height of the Parallelogram\n1. Divide the original rectangle into four triangles by the two folds. Each triangle has a base \\(10 \\, \\text{cm}\\) along one of the shorter sides and a height that is a fraction of the diagonal (\\(10\\sqrt{5}\\)).\n\n2. Observe that each fold creates a parallelogram whose height is equal to the perpendicular distance between the two folds. By symmetry, this height is equal to:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height} = \\frac{\\text{area of the rectangle}}{\\text{base of the parallelogram}} = \\frac{10 \\times 20}{10\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{200}{10\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{20}{\\sqrt{5}} = 4\\sqrt{5}.\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Area of the Parallelogram\nThe area of a parallelogram is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we calculated:\n\\[\n\\text{Base} = 10\\sqrt{5}, \\quad \\text{Height} = 4\\sqrt{5}.\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = (10\\sqrt{5})(4\\sqrt{5}) = 10 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 200.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Verify and Match with Given Options\nThe final area of the parallelogram is \\(200 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\).

The height can be determined by analyzing proportions in similar triangles.\n2. Using folding geometry and the relationship between the dimensions, the height of the parallelogram is found to be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Height} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 20}{\\sqrt{10^2 + 20^2}} = \\frac{200}{10\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{20}{\\sqrt{5}} = 4\\sqrt{5}.\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the area of the parallelogram\n\nThe area of a parallelogram is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height}.\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- The base of the parallelogram is the diagonal of the rectangle: \\(10\\sqrt{5}\\),\n- The height of the parallelogram is \\(4\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\nThus:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = (10\\sqrt{5}) \\cdot (4\\sqrt{5}) = 40 \\cdot 5 = 200 \\, \\text{cm}^2.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Check the options\n\nThe area of the quadrilateral formed is \\(200 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\).
