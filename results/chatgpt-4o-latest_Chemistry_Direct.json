Assume R represents carbon.\n\n- Bond Count: Determine the total number of bonds in the structure, including single, double, and triple bonds but excluding those involving hydrogen.\n\nNote: Disregard arrows. Consider all components present in the transition-state structure shown in the image.\nAnswer the question using a single word or phrase and put the answer in one \"\\boxed{}\". Please ensure that your output only contains the final answer without any additional content (such as intermediate reasoning steps).In particular, fill in the two numbers of your answer in the following format:\nAtom Count: \\boxed{}, Bond Count: \\boxed{}\".
