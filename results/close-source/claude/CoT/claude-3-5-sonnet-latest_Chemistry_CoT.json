The larger and more electronegative the substituents, the higher the rotation barrier.\n\n2) Let's analyze each structure:\n   * Structure I: CH\u2082=CH\u2082 (ethene)\n   * Structure II: CH\u2083O-CH=CH\u2082 (vinyl methyl ether)\n   * Structure III: CH\u2083O-CH=CH-C(=O)OEt (an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester)\n\n3) Factors affecting rotation barrier:\n   * Conjugation increases rotation barrier\n   * Electron-withdrawing groups increase barrier\n   * Steric hindrance increases barrier\n\n4) Comparing the structures:\n   * III has the most substituents and conjugation with the ester group\n   * II has methoxy group which provides some electronic effects\n   * I is the simplest with no substituents\n\n5) Therefore:\n   * III will have highest barrier due to conjugation and substituents\n   * II will have intermediate barrier due to methoxy group\n   * I will have lowest barrier as it's the simplest alkene\n\n6) The correct order is: III > II > I\n\nTherefore, \\boxed{B} is the correct answer."
