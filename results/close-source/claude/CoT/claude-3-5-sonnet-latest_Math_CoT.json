    "answer": "3",
    "solution": "The dominoes in the line contain three ends with four spots and three ends with six spots, as shown in diagram 1. Therefore, a correctly arranged set of these dominoes will have four spots at one end and six spots at the other, as is currently the case. Hence, Paul does not need to move either of the end dominoes.  If he swaps the third and the fifth dominoes from diagram 1, he obtains the row shown in diagram 2 which has the same number of spots in the adjacent ends of the fourth, fifth and sixth dominoes. Next, if he swaps the second and third dominoes from diagram 2 to obtain the line shown in diagram 3 , he has matched the spots at the adjacent ends of the first and second dominoes. Finally, rotating the third domino in diagram 3, he obtains the correctly arranged line as shown in diagram 4 . This shows that it is possible to arrange the dominos correctly in three moves.  To see that two moves is not sufficient, note that, whatever else needs to happen, the two $1 \\mathrm{~s}$ must be correctly placed next to each other. To do that requires one of the dominos with a 1 to be rotated and then one pair of dominos to be swapped so that the two $1 \\mathrm{~s}$ are now next to each other. A similar argument applies to the two dominos with a 3. However, this is not possible in only two moves.

Hence, the total number of white faces on the edge of the large cube is an even number and the total number of white faces on the corners of the large cube is a multiple of 3 . The five faces shown contain 1 centre white face from 1 small white cube, 12 edge white faces and 5 corner white faces. Therefore, since the total number of white faces on the corners is a multiple of 3 , the missing face contains 1 or 4 white faces at its corners. None of the options contains 4 white corners so the missing face contains one white corner as in options A and E, making 6 in total. These 6 faces come from $6 \\div 3=2$ small white cubes. Both options $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ have two white faces on their edges, making 14 in total over the six faces from $14 \\div 2=7$ white cubes. Hence the number of white cubes whose positions we know is $1+7+2=10$. The large cube is made with 12 small white cubes so there are still two more to be placed. One can be at the centre of the large cube and the only place the remaining cube can be is at the centre of the missing face. Therefore, the missing face contains one centre white face, two edge white faces and one corner white face. Hence, the missing face is A. (This proof shows that the only possible missing face for such a cube is face A. It is left to the reader to check that the five given faces and face A can indeed be fitted together consistently to form the faces of a cube.)",

    "solution": "The computer will draw its path over 2 minutes or 120 seconds. The number of unit lengths successively between the points $(1,0),(0,2),(3,0),(0,4),(5,0)$, and so on, increases by 2 each time. Starting at 1 and adding consecutive odd numbers leads to the sequence of square numbers, and so the path will reach $(n, 0)$, where $n$ is an odd number, after $n^{2}$ seconds. So after 121 seconds it would reach $(11,0)$ and after 2 minutes $(10,0)$. Alternatively, when the computer path reaches a grid point, shade grey the unit square immediately below and to the left of that point. For example, the diagram shows the area shaded grey when the path has reached $(2,0)$. Since each unit added to the path also adds one unit to the grey shaded area, the path length and the grey shaded area have the same numerical value. For convenience, shade black the unit square below and to the left of $(0,0)$. After 2 minutes, or 120 seconds, the path length is 120 , so the grey shaded area is 120 , and the total shaded area is 121 . But $121=11^{2}$, so that the total shaded area is a square of side 11 and the path has reached $(10,0)$. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_27_0f4ed2787981bb911326g-038.jpg?height=385&width=412&top_left_y=2149&top_left_x=1413)",

Observe that if a laser is fired with an angle of $n$ degrees from the tangent, then the number of points it creates on the circle is $\\frac{180}{\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)}$. (Consider the regular polygon created by linking all the points that show up on the circle-if the center of the circle is $\\mathrm{O}$, and the vertices are numbered $V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_k$, the angle $\\angle V_1 O V_2$ is equal to $2 \\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)$, so there are a total of $\\frac{360}{2 \\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)}$ sides).\\nNow, we consider the case with both $n$ and $n+1$.

This occurs when $n=80$. Plugging this into our expression, we have that the number of points that show up from the laser fired at 80 degrees is $\\frac{180}{20}=9$ and the number of points that appear from the laser fired at 81 degrees is $\\frac{180}{9}=20$.

    "solution": "Firstly, we claim that the shortest possible sequence is $8$ moves long. We observe that it must be strictly longer than $5$ moves because the average move adds less than $4$; if it's $6$ moves, then the total sum is odd because we are adding three odds and three evens; if it's $7$ moves, the total sum is also still odd.\\n\\nThe longest possible sequence is the sequence $2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2$, which is $13$ moves long.\\n\\nWe begin by considering $8$-move sequences. Begin with the $8$-tuple $(2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1)$; the current sum is $12$, so we need to add $2$ to four of these elements. This yields $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$ possibilities.\\n\\nNext, $9$-move sequences. $(2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2)$ has a sum of $14$, so we need to add $2$ to three of these elements. This yields $\\binom{9}{3} = 84$ possibilities.\\n\\nThere are no $10$ or $11$-move sequences for parity reasons.\\n\\n$12$-move sequences: $(2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1)$ has a sum of $18$, so we add $2$ to one element. This gives $12$ possibilities. Finally, there is exactly one $13$-move sequence.\\n\\nOur total is $70 + 84 + 12 + 1 = \\boxed{167}.$",
