    "solution": "['Let us consider $N=1$ equilateral triangles. From inspection, we need to place the triangle such that the center of mass lies at the edge of the table. The maximum overhang in this case is $(1-f) h$ where $h=\\\\frac{\\\\ell \\\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is the height of the triangle and $f h=\\\\frac{h}{3}$ is the location of the center of mass.\\nIf we wish to place a second triangle on top, we want to maximize the center of mass to be as far right as possible without the top block toppling. Placing the second block such that its center of mass is at the tip of the first triangle accomplishes this. However, the center of mass of the two triangles combined is now past the edge. Their center of mass is:\\n\\n$$\\nx_{\\\\mathrm{cm}}=\\\\frac{f h+h}{2}=\\\\frac{f+1}{2} h\\n$$\\n\\nThus the maximum overhang of the first block is now:\\n\\n$$\\nh-\\\\frac{f+1}{2} h=\\\\frac{1-f}{2} h\\n$$\\n\\nNow, we will place a third block such that it has the maximum overhang with respect to the top block and then shift the entire setup so that the center of mass of the system lies at the edge of the table. Following the same procedures, we find that the maximum overhang of the first block is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1-f}{3} h\\n$$\\n\\nThe overhang of the top two blocks are $(1-f) h$ and $\\\\frac{1-f}{2} h$, unchanged from earlier.

    "solution": "['Define point $O$ as the point in the plane that the axis of rotation passes through. Since moments of inertia simply add about a given axis, we can calculate the moments of inertia of the three \"sectors\" whose union forms the given area and subtract twice the moment of inertia of the triangle, so our answer will be $3 I_{s, O}-2 I_{t, O}$.\\nClaim: The center of mass of a sector is $\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi}$ away from the vertex of the sector along its axis of symmetry. Proof: We can divide the sector into arbitrarily small sectors that can be approximated as isosceles triangles. It\\'s well known that the center of mass of one such isosceles triangle is $\\\\frac{2}{3}$ of the way from the central vertex to the base. Therefore, the center of mass of the sector is the center of mass of the arc with central angle $\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{3}$ and same center with radius $\\\\frac{2}{3}$ contained within the sector. Since the center of mass has to lie on the axis of symmetry, we set that as the $\\\\mathrm{x}$ axis with the vertex of the sector being $x=0$. Then, the $x$-coordinate of a point on the arc whose corresponding radius makes an angle of $\\\\theta$ with the axis of symmetry is $\\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\cos (\\\\theta)$. We can integrate this over all possible angles $\\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{6} \\\\leq \\\\theta \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{6}\\\\right)$ and then divide by the range $\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{3}\\\\right)$ to get the average $x$-coordinate, or the center of mass.\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{gathered}\\n\\\\frac{\\\\int_{-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{6}}^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{6}} \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\cos (\\\\theta) \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\theta}{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{3}} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_{-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{6}}^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{6}} \\\\cos (\\\\theta) \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi}\\\\left(\\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{6}\\\\right)-\\\\sin \\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{6}\\\\right)\\\\right)\\n\\\\end{gathered}\\n$$\\n\\n\\n\\nThis concludes the proof.\\n\\nNow define point $X$ as the vertex of a sector and point $M$ as the center of mass of that sector. According to the parallel axis theorem,\\n\\n$$\\nI_{s, X}=I_{s, M}+m_{s}\\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi}\\\\right)^{2}\\n$$\\n\\n. It\\'s well known that $I_{s, X}=\\\\frac{1}{2} m_{s} r^{2}=\\\\frac{m_{s}}{2}$, and so\\n\\n$$\\nI_{s, M}=\\\\frac{m_{s}}{2}-\\\\frac{4 m_{s}}{\\\\pi^{2}}=m_{s}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi^{2}-8}{2 \\\\pi^{2}}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nIt\\'s also well known that $O$ is on the line of symmetry and a distance of $\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}$ away from $X$, and so $M X=$ $\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi}-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}$. Therefore,\\n\\n$$\\nI_{s, O}=I_{s, M}+m_{s}\\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi}-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\right)^{2}=m_{s}\\\\left(\\\\frac{5 \\\\pi-8 \\\\sqrt{3}}{6 \\\\pi}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nIt\\'s well known that, since $O$ is the center of mass of the triangle,\\n\\n$$\\nI_{t, O}=\\\\frac{1}{12}\\n$$\\n\\nNow we just need to calculate $m_{s}$. Since the mass of the triangle is $1 \\\\mathrm{~kg}$, this is equivalent to finding the ratio of the area of a sector to the area of a triangle. Through geometry, this is found to be $\\\\frac{2 \\\\pi}{3 \\\\sqrt{3}}$. Finally, we get our answer to be\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left(\\\\frac{2 \\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac{5 \\\\pi-8 \\\\sqrt{3}}{6 \\\\pi}\\\\right)-\\\\frac{1}{6}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{10 \\\\pi-17 \\\\sqrt{3}}{6 \\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nand $a+b+c+d+e=10+17+3+6+3=039$']",

    "question": "A square based pyramid (that is symmetrical) is standing on top of a cube with side length $\\ell=10 \\mathrm{~cm}$ such that their square faces perfectly line up. The cube is initially standing still on flat ground and both objects have the same uniform density. The coefficient of friction between every surface is the same value of $\\mu=0.3$. The cube is then given an initial speed $v$ in some direction parallel to the floor. What is the maximum possible value of $v$ such that the base of the pyramid will always remain parallel to the top of the cube? Answer in meters per second.\n\n<image_1>",

    "answer": "B",
    "solution": "[\"For this part, we regard the basketball as a point mass. Now to account for the backboard bounce, we reflect the hoop over the backboard. The problem is now equivalent to making it into the hoop that is 4.15 meters away now. So now we need to find the smallest velocity to reach this point. One way to do it is to use the safety parabola, which makes it so minimal calculations are needed, so we present that method here. However, this problem is also readily solvable with only basic kinematics.\\nThe point that the ball must hit (4.15 meters in front and 1 meter above) lies on the safety parabola when it is thrown at minimum speed. Since the focus of the safety parabola is the point of launch,\\n\\n\\n\\nthe directrix is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\sqrt{1^{2}+4.15^{2}}=4.27 \\\\mathrm{~m}\\n$$\\n\\naway from the top of the hoop. The distance from the focus to the vertex of the parabola is then $(4.27+1) / 2=2.63 \\\\mathrm{~m}$. So the minimum velocity to go this height is given by\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{v^{2}}{2 g}=2.63 \\\\mathrm{~m}\\n$$\\n\\nand that gives $v=7.19 \\\\mathrm{~m} / \\\\mathrm{s}$. There is one last bit we need to check to complete this problem. The basketball's trajectory has to actually be possible (i.e. it doesn't go underneath the rim). It is clearly less optimal intuitively. If it passes through the underside, it means that its apex of the trajectory is very near its target.\"]",

    "solution": "['First note that the thread is given to be very long. Therefore, only vertical tension and gravitational forces act on the rod allowing for its center of mass to move in a straight vertical line. Using this fact, we can now write the acceleration of the rod in terms of angular velocity $\\\\omega$ and angular acceleration $\\\\varepsilon$. Let the angle of the rod at any moment to the vertical be $\\\\varphi$. For simplicity, we define the length of the rod to be $2 l$. Then, by defining the coordinate $y$ to be the change in vertical length of the rod where $y=l \\\\cos \\\\varphi$, one can write for varying $\\\\varphi \\\\in[\\\\varphi, \\\\varphi+\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\varphi)$ that $l \\\\cos (\\\\varphi+\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\varphi)=y+\\\\mathrm{d} y \\\\Longrightarrow \\\\mathrm{d} y=l \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\varphi$. Thus, simple differentiation proves that\\n$$\\nv=l \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\omega \\\\Longrightarrow a=l \\\\varepsilon \\\\sin \\\\varphi+l \\\\omega^{2} \\\\cos \\\\varphi\\n$$\\n\\nWe can now also write conservation of energy to get another relationship between velocity and angular velocity. At any given moment, it can be written that $m g l=\\\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}+\\\\frac{1}{2} I \\\\omega^{2}-m g l \\\\cos \\\\varphi$. Since $I=\\\\frac{1}{2} m(2 l)^{2}=\\\\frac{1}{3} m l^{2}$, then\\n\\n$$\\nm g l(1+\\\\cos \\\\varphi)=m l^{2} \\\\omega^{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sin ^{2} \\\\varphi+\\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nOur third equation comes from the fact that the tension on the rod at any moment can be written as $T=m g-m a \\\\Longrightarrow m a=m g-T$. We can finally get a fourth equation by equating torques such that $\\\\frac{1}{3} m l^{2} \\\\varepsilon=T l \\\\sin \\\\varphi$. With these four equations, simple algebra yields the tension at any point is\\n\\n$$\\nT(\\\\varphi)=\\\\frac{1+(3 \\\\cos \\\\varphi-1)^{2}}{\\\\left(1+3 \\\\sin ^{2} \\\\varphi\\\\right)^{2}} m g \\\\Longrightarrow T_{\\\\min } \\\\approx 0.165 m g\\n$$']",

    "answer": "A",
    "solution": "[\"We will work in the reference frame of the center of mass of the cylinder because the fluid flow is steady in this reference frame. The key intuition here is that the magnitude of the fluid velocity above the cylinder will be higher on the top because the tangential velocity of the cylinder is in the same direction as the velocity of the fluid on the top. By Bernoulli's principle, this means that the pressure on the top is lower than the pressure on the bottom, which will create a lift force on the cylinder.\\nWith the given theory, we can model this quantitatively. In our chosen reference frame, the water\\n\\n\\n\\nmoves with velocity $v$ to the left. The velocity potential around a cylinder with radius $R$ is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Phi(r, \\\\theta)=-v r \\\\cos \\\\theta-v \\\\frac{R^{2}}{r} \\\\cos \\\\theta+R^{2} \\\\omega \\\\theta\\n$$\\n\\nTherefore, we find\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\nabla \\\\Phi=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial r} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}+\\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\hat{\\\\theta}=-v\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{R^{2}}{r^{2}}\\\\right) \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{r}}+\\\\left(v\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{R^{2}}{r^{2}}\\\\right) \\\\sin \\\\theta+R \\\\omega\\\\right) \\\\hat{\\\\theta}\\n$$\\n\\nAs expected from boundary conditions, the radial velocity vanishes when $r=R$. Furthermore, on the surface of the cylinder, we have the tangential velocity of the fluid is $2 v \\\\sin \\\\theta+R \\\\omega$ in the counterclockwise direction. Consider points on the cylinder at angles $\\\\theta$ and $-\\\\theta$. By Bernoulli's principle (ignoring the height difference which will be accounted with the buoyant force),\\n\\n$$\\np_{-\\\\theta}-p_{\\\\theta}=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho\\\\left((2 v \\\\sin \\\\theta+R \\\\omega)^{2}-(-2 v \\\\sin \\\\theta+R \\\\omega)^{2}\\\\right)=4 \\\\rho v R \\\\omega \\\\sin \\\\theta\\n$$\\n\\nIf we integrate this result along the surface of the cylinder, we can find the lift force per unit length. Note that only the vertical components of the pressure will matter as the horizontal components cancel due to symmetry. The vertical component of the pressure difference is then $4 \\\\rho v r_{0} \\\\omega \\\\sin ^{2} \\\\theta$. Thus, the lift force per unit length is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{F_{\\\\text {lift }}}{H}=\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\pi} 4 \\\\rho v R \\\\omega \\\\sin ^{2}(\\\\theta)(R d \\\\theta)=2 \\\\pi \\\\rho \\\\omega v R^{2}\\n$$\\n\\nThe total left force is\\n\\n$$\\nF_{\\\\text {lift }}=2 \\\\pi \\\\rho R^{2} H \\\\omega v \\\\text {. }\\n$$\\n\\nThe gravitational force is $M g$, and the buoyant force is $\\\\pi R^{2} H \\\\rho g$.

We can furthermore approximate the field produced by one of the horizontal wires a distance $r$ away as\\n\\n\\n\\n$\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I}{2 \\\\pi r}$ (this is valid for an infinitely long wire, and therefore is also valid in the regime where $w \\\\ll \\\\ell$ ).\\n\\nThus, the total flux through the rectangular loop when there is a current $I_{1}$ is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Phi_{1}=\\\\int_{r}^{w} B\\\\left(\\\\ell d r^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)=\\\\int_{r}^{w-r}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{1}}{2 \\\\pi r^{\\\\prime}}+\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{1}}{2 \\\\pi\\\\left(w-r^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)}\\\\right) \\\\ell d r^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{1} \\\\ell}{\\\\pi} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{w}{r}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nNote that the self inductance of the loop is $L=\\\\frac{\\\\Phi}{I_{1}}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell}{\\\\pi} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{w}{r}\\\\right)$.\\n\\nNow, we will determine the flux through the rectangular loop due to the long current-carrying wire. This is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Phi_{2}=\\\\int_{d}^{d+w} \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\\\pi r}(\\\\ell d r)=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2} \\\\ell}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{d+w}{d}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nThe mutual inductance is $M=\\\\frac{\\\\Phi_{2}}{I_{2}}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{d+w}{d}\\\\right)$. In to maintain the same flux in the loop, the current will change to $I_{3}$ where\\n\\n$$\\nL I_{1}=M I_{2}+L I_{3}\\n$$\\n\\nor\\n\\n$$\\nI_{3}=I_{1}-\\\\frac{M}{L} I_{2}\\n$$\\n\\nNow, we compute the force between the rectangular loop and the long, current-carrying wire. The forces on the vertical sides cancel out because the current in the loop is in opposite directions on these sides. From the horizontal sides, we have the force is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\nF=\\\\sum\\\\left(I_{3} \\\\vec{\\\\ell} \\\\times \\\\vec{B}\\\\right) & =I_{3} \\\\ell\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\\\pi d}-\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\\\pi(d+w)}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\n& =\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell w}{2 \\\\pi d(d+w)}\\\\left[I_{2}\\\\left(I_{1}-\\\\frac{M}{L} I_{2}\\\\right)\\\\right] .\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nThis quadratic in $I_{2}$ is maximized when $I_{2}=\\\\frac{L}{2 M} I_{1}$ in which case the force becomes\\n\\n$$\\nF=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell w}{2 \\\\pi d(d+w)} \\\\frac{L I_{1}^{2}}{4 M}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\ell w I_{1}^{2}}{4 \\\\pi d(d+w)} \\\\frac{\\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{w}{r}\\\\right)}{\\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{d+w}{d}\\\\right)}\\n$$\\n\\nNote: If the size of the wires is considered when computing flux, a slightly different answer is obtained.

Consider a simple case when the cube is pushed to one side.\\n<img_4314>\\n\\nIf we label the vertices of the cube from 1 to 4 clockwise, where 1 is the top left side, it is apparent that sides 1 and 2 provide a positive torque while sides 3 and 4 provide a negative torque. As the displacement is small, the angles created are small enough such that $\\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\approx \\\\theta$. As force is\\n\\n\\n\\nproportional to the extension of the spring as $F \\\\propto x$, we can write that\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\tau \\\\propto \\\\theta\\\\left(r_{+}+r_{-}-r_{+}-r_{-}\\\\right) \\\\propto 0\\n$$\\n\\nIf torque is zero when the cube is displaced in the $x$-direction, then by symmetry, the torque is zero when the cube is displaced in the $y$-direction. Superposing both solutions implies that torque as a function of displacements in the $x$ and $y$ directions $\\\\alpha \\\\hat{x}+\\\\beta \\\\hat{y}$ is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\tau(\\\\alpha x+\\\\beta y)=\\\\tau(\\\\alpha x)+\\\\tau(\\\\beta y)=\\\\alpha \\\\tau(x)+\\\\beta \\\\tau(y)=0\\n$$\\n\\n1.Label the vertices of the outer cube as $1,2, \\\\ldots, 8$ and the vectors that point to these vertices from the inner cube as $\\\\vec{r}_{1}, \\\\vec{r}_{2}, \\\\ldots, \\\\vec{r}_{2}$.

    "solution": "['Let us analyse, what would be the change of the magnetic energy when one of the straws is displaced to a small distance. The magnetic field inside the tubes will remain constant due to the conservation of magnetic flux, but outside, the magnetic field will be changed. The magnetic field outside the straws is defined by the following condition: there is no circulation of $\\\\vec{B}$ (because there are no currents outside the straws); there are no sources of the field lines, other than the endpoints of the straws; each of the endpoints of the straws is a source of streamlines with a fixed magnetic flux $\\\\pm \\\\Phi$. These are exactly the same condition as those which define the electric field of four charges $\\\\pm Q$. We know that if the distance between charges is much larger than the geometrical size of a charge, the charges can be considered as point charges (the electric field near the charges remains almost constant, so that the respective contribution to the change of the overall electric field energy is negligible). Therefore we can conclude that the endpoints of the straws can be considered as magnetic point charges. In order to calculate the force between two magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles), we need to establish the correspondence between magnetic and electric quantities.\\n\\nFor two electric charges $Q$ separated by a distance $a$, the force is $F=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{2}}$, and at the position of one charge, the electric field of the other charge has energy density $w=\\\\frac{1}{32 \\\\pi^{2} \\\\varepsilon_{0}} \\\\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{4}}$; hence we can write $F=8 \\\\pi w a^{2}$. This is a universal expression for the force (for the case when the field lines have the same shape as in the case of two opposite and equal by modulus electric charges) relying only on the energy density, and not related to the nature of the field; so we can apply it to the magnetic\\n\\n\\n\\nfield. Indeed, the force can be calculated as a derivative of the full field energy with respect to a virtual displacement of a field line source (electric or magnetic charge); if the energy densities of two fields are respectively equal at one point, they are equal everywhere, and so are equal the full field energies. As it follows from the Gauss law, for a point source of a fixed magnetic flux $\\\\Phi$ at a distance $a$, the induction $B=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\Phi}{a^{2}}$. So, the energy density $w=\\\\frac{B^{2}}{2 \\\\mu_{0}}=\\\\frac{1}{32 \\\\pi^{2} \\\\mu_{0}} \\\\frac{\\\\Phi^{2}}{a^{4}}$, hence\\n\\n$$\\nF=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\mu_{0}} \\\\frac{\\\\Phi^{2}}{a^{2}}\\n$$\\n\\nFor the two straws, we have four magnetic charges. The longitudinal (along a straw axis) forces cancel out (the diagonally positioned pairs of same-sign-charges push in opposite directions). The normal force is a superposition of the attraction due to the two pairs of opposite charges, $F_{1}=\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\mu_{0}} \\\\frac{\\\\Phi^{2}}{l^{2}}$, and the repulsive forces of diagonal pairs, $F_{2}=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{8 \\\\pi \\\\mu_{0}} \\\\frac{\\\\Phi^{2}}{2 l^{2}}$.

CERN is the world's largest particle physics laboratory. Its main goal is to get insight into the fundamental laws of nature. Two beams of particles are accelerated to high energies, guided around the accelerator ring by a strong magnetic field and then made to collide with each other. The protons are not spread uniformly around the circumference of the accelerator, but they are clustered in so-called bunches. The resulting particles generated by collisions are observed with large detectors. Some parameters of the LHC can be found in table 1 .\n\n| LHC ring |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Circumference of ring | $26659 \\mathrm{~m}$ |\n| Number of bunches per proton beam | 2808 |\n| Number of protons per bunch | $1.15 \\times 10^{11}$ |\n| Proton beams |  |\n| Energy of protons | $7.00 \\mathrm{TeV}$ |\n| Centre of mass energy | $14.0 \\mathrm{TeV}$ |\n\nTable 1: Typical numerical values of relevant LHC parameters.\n\nParticle physicists use convenient units for the energy, momentum and mass: The energy is measured in electron volts $[\\mathrm{eV}]$. By definition, $1 \\mathrm{eV}$ is the amount of energy gained by a particle with elementary charge, e, moved through a potential difference of one volt $\\left(1 \\mathrm{eV}=1.602 \\cdot 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\mathrm{~s}^{-2}\\right)$.\n\nThe momentum is measured in units of $\\mathrm{eV} / c$ and the mass in units of $\\mathrm{eV} / c^{2}$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. Since $1 \\mathrm{eV}$ is a very small quantity of energy, particle physicists often use $\\mathrm{MeV}\\left(1 \\mathrm{MeV}=10^{6} \\mathrm{eV}\\right)$, $\\mathrm{GeV}\\left(1 \\mathrm{GeV}=10^{9} \\mathrm{eV}\\right)$ or $\\mathrm{TeV}\\left(1 \\mathrm{TeV}=10^{12} \\mathrm{eV}\\right)$.\n\nPart A deals with the acceleration of protons or electrons.

A common mistake was assuming $L=m v_{x} r$ or a variant thereof.)\"\n \"The net effect on the disk of one ant going in the circular path is the same as two ants going along the path, each with half the mass, and thus the same as four ants each with a quarter the mass, and so on.

On the verge of slipping, the direction of $\\\\Delta f$ is parallel to the $z$-axis. Since the small piece of thread is in equilibrium, the $x$-component of the tension is the same everywhere:\\n\\n$$\\nT_{x}=\\\\text { const. }\\n$$\\n\\nThe normal force $\\\\Delta N$ can be determined by looking at the top view of the loop in Fig. 1. The polar angle corresponding to small piece of thread is $\\\\Delta \\\\varphi=\\\\Delta x / R$, so the force balance in the radial direction can be written as\\n\\n$$\\n2 T_{x} \\\\underbrace{\\\\sin \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\varphi}{2}}_{\\\\approx \\\\Delta \\\\varphi / 2}-\\\\Delta N=0 \\\\quad \\\\longrightarrow \\\\quad \\\\Delta N=T_{x} \\\\frac{\\\\Delta x}{R} .\\n\\\\tag{4}\\n$$\\n\\nThe frictional force on the verge of slipping is given by\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Delta f=\\\\mu \\\\Delta N\\n\\\\tag{5}\\n$$\\n\\nThus, the force balance on the small piece of thread in the $z$ direction (see Fig. 2):\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\left.T_{x} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} z}{\\\\mathrm{~d} x}\\\\right|_{x+\\\\Delta x}-\\\\left.T_{x} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} z}{\\\\mathrm{~d} x}\\\\right|_{x}-\\\\Delta f=0\\n\\\\tag{6}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere we expressed the $z$-component of the tension forces with $T_{x}$ and the tangent $\\\\mathrm{d} z / \\\\mathrm{d} x$. Using the three equations above and taking the limit $\\\\Delta x \\\\rightarrow 0$, we get the differential equation\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^{2} z}{\\\\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{R}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere we used the fact that $T_{x} \\\\neq 0$. By direct integration and taking into account the boundary conditions $z(0)=0$ and $z^{\\\\prime}(0)=0$ we get\\n\\n$$\\nz(x)=\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{2 R} x^{2}\\n$$\\n\\nso the shape of the thread on the unfolded side surface (Fig. 2) can be described by a parabola.\\nThe thread needs to span over the entire cylinder, so its length can be calculated as\\n\\n$$\\nL_{0}=\\\\int_{-\\\\pi R}^{\\\\pi R} \\\\sqrt{\\\\mathrm{d} x^{2}+\\\\mathrm{d} z^{2}}=2 \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\pi R} \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} z}{\\\\mathrm{~d} x}\\\\right)^{2}} \\\\mathrm{~d} x\\n$$\\n\\nSubstituting the $z(x)$ function we get:\\n\\n$$\\nL_{0}=2 \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\pi R} \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu x}{R}\\\\right)^{2}} \\\\mathrm{~d} x=\\\\left(\\\\frac{R}{\\\\mu}\\\\right) 2 \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\pi \\\\mu} \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\xi^{2}} \\\\mathrm{~d} \\\\xi\\n$$\\n\\nwhere we introduced the notation $\\\\xi=\\\\mu x / R$.

In the limit $\\\\mu \\\\rightarrow 0$ the loop slips even if $L=2 \\\\pi R$, which should be reproduced by our final formula. Using the relation for the inverse hyperbolic function given in the problem text, then expanding the logarithm in Taylor series in linear order around 0 we get:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\operatorname{arcsinh} x \\\\equiv \\\\ln \\\\left(x+\\\\sqrt{1+x^{2}}\\\\right) \\\\approx \\\\ln (x+1) \\\\approx x\\n$$\\n\\nso for small values of $\\\\mu$ we get\\n\\n$$\\nL_{0} \\\\approx \\\\pi R+\\\\frac{R}{\\\\mu}(\\\\pi \\\\mu)=2 \\\\pi R\\n$$']",

Consider a point $Q$ on the end of the thread being pulled that coincided with $P$ at the moment when it touched the cylinder. Consider motion of the thread in a system of reference (SR), which rotates at angular speed $\\\\omega=u / R$ around the center of the cylinder. In that SR the part of the thread in contact with the cylinder is at rest and the point $Q$ rotates around the cylinder with the angular velocity $\\\\omega_{Q}=-\\\\omega$ (see the figure).\\nSince the middle part of the thread is at rest, energy of the mass $P$ is conserved. For the same reason, the velocity $v_{P}$ of $P$ is perpendicular to the thread. Therefore the kinetic energy acquired by the mass in the rotating frame is equal to the decrease of its centrifugal potential energy:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{2} m v_{P}^{2}=-\\\\frac{1}{2} m \\\\omega^{2} R^{2}+\\\\frac{1}{2} m \\\\omega^{2} r^{2}=\\\\frac{1}{2} m \\\\omega^{2} l_{P}^{2}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $l_{P}$ is the length of the unwound part of the thread on the side of the mass $P$ (see the figure).

    "solution": "['When you look at the photo of the lens and/or the graph provided, four regions with different brightness levels can be distinguished. The brightest region represents the magnified image of the blur spot created by the lamp through the lens. The blur spot is created because the distance from the lens to the white sheet beneath it is slightly larger than the focal distance; as we can see from the graph, the blur spot is of almost constant brightness (a flat plateau at $\\\\log _{10} I=4.4$ ), so we can say that the entire luminous flux falling from the lamp onto the lens is distributed evenly over the blur spot. Note that the blur spot has no sharp edges, though, as you would expect from in such case. This is because the image of this bright disc is situated between the lens and the camera, and is at a fairly big distance away from the plane which is sharp at the image sensor (as seen from the photo, the camera is focused onto the lens). Because of that, the enlarged image of the blur spot has blurred edges in the photo (at the blurred edges, $\\\\log _{10} I$ varies from 3.4 to 4.4). The second-brightest region (with $\\\\log _{10} I=3.4$ ) represents the scattered light from the brightest region: in that region, we are still looking through the lens, and see the area next to the bright blur spot on the sheet. Ideally, its should be darker than the sheet seen in those places where it is not obstructed by the lens, because the lens is shading the light from the lamp. However, the glass elements of this big lens are non-ideal (and there are many glass elements inside the lens!), so the light from the lamp and the bright blur spot is scattered towards the camera giving rise to an increased apparent brightness. In the area where we see the blur spot, this light is insignificant (much weaker than the light from the blur spot), but not so in this dark area: here, the scatteredfrom-the-glass-surfaces dominates heavily over the light coming from the paper sheet. As a matter of fact, this fact could be used to improve the accuracy of the calculations: we could subtract the contribution of the scattered light $\\\\left(10^{3.4}\\\\right)$ from the total intensity of the light at the brightest spot $\\\\left(10^{4.4}\\\\right)$ to obtain the contribution coming from the blur spot on the sheet. The darkest regions (with $\\\\log _{10} I<1.75$ ) represent the interior black painting of the lens seen through the big front glass element of the lens, which absorbs most of the incident light, and the region with $x>420$ and $\\\\log _{10} I=1.95$ represents the white sheet illuminated by the lamp. The ratio between the measured light intensity of the brightest region and that of the region with $x>420$ can be utilized to find the distance of the sheet (the blur spot) from the lens to the paper sheet $d_{0}$, see below.\\n\\nFrom the data given in the problem text we know that $L \\\\gg f$; from the photo of the lens, it is also clear that $d_{0}$ is of the same order of magnitude as $f$. Because of that, the illuminance $E$ (luminous flux per unit area) near the lens can be assumed to be the same as at the paper sheet, The luminous flux per solid angle and unit area of a lightscattering (or radiating) surface is called the luminance $\\\\mathscr{L}$; since all these directions under which the scattered light enters the lens aperture are close to the surface nor$\\\\mathrm{mal}$, we may assume the luminance of the paper sheet to be constant over all these directions. With the small\\n\\n\\n\\nangle approximation, the light intensity $I$ (illuminance, luminous flux $\\\\Phi$ per unit area) at the camera sensor is proportional to $\\\\mathscr{L}$ (see Explanation 1).\\n\\nThe luminance of the blur spot on the sheet $\\\\mathscr{L}_{B S}$ is $1 / k$ larger than the luminance $\\\\mathscr{L}_{s}$ of the paper sheet, where $k$ equals the ratio between the area of the bright dot (the blur spot) on the paper sheet and the area of the lens, because all the light received by the lens is \"compressed\" into the tiny blur spot.\\n\\nSmall angle approximation is also used to show that luminance of the image of the blur spot $\\\\mathscr{L}_{I}$ equals to the luminance of the blur spot $\\\\mathscr{L}_{B S}$ (see Explanation 2). Therefore, the light intensity at the sensor cells corresponding to the brightest area (where we see the image of the blur spot) $I_{I}=I_{s} / k$, where $I_{s}$ stands for the intensity at the cells corresponding to unobscured paper sheet. So, from the graph, we can deduce the value of $k$, and knowing $k$ we can calculate $d_{0}$. Let the distance along the axis between the image of the bright region through the lens and the lens itself be denoted as $d_{S}$; according to the Newton\\'s lens formula, $\\\\left(d_{S}-f\\\\right)\\\\left(d_{0}-f\\\\right)=$ $f^{2}$. Hence,\\n\\n$$\\nd_{S}=f+\\\\frac{f^{2}}{d_{0}-f}=\\\\frac{d_{0} f}{\\\\left(d_{0}-f\\\\right)}\\n$$\\n\\ncan be also determined.\\n\\nHypothesize that $d_{0}-f \\\\ll f$. Let us calculate the diameter of the image of the blur spot\\n\\n$$\\nD_{I}=\\\\frac{D_{B S} d_{S}}{d_{0}}=\\\\frac{D_{B S} f}{d_{0}-f}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere the diameter of the blur spot on the sheet\\n\\n$$\\nD_{B S}=\\\\frac{D\\\\left(d_{0}-f-s\\\\right)}{f+s} \\\\approx \\\\frac{D\\\\left(d_{0}-f-s\\\\right)}{f}\\n$$\\n\\nand $s$ denotes the distance of the image of the point source from the focal plane. Using Newton\\'s lens formula, $s=f^{2} /\\\\left(L-f-d_{0}\\\\right) \\\\approx f^{2} / L$, This leads us to\\n\\n$$\\nD_{B S} \\\\approx D\\\\left(\\\\frac{d_{0}-f}{f}-\\\\frac{f}{L}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nand therefore\\n\\n$$\\nD_{I} \\\\approx D\\\\left[1-\\\\frac{f^{2}}{L\\\\left(d_{0}-f\\\\right)}\\\\right]\\n$$\\n\\nKeeping in mind that $d_{0}-f=\\\\frac{d_{0} f}{d_{S}} \\\\approx \\\\frac{f^{2}}{d_{S}}$, we obtain\\n\\n$$\\nD_{I} \\\\approx D\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{d_{S}}{L}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{D\\\\left(L-d_{S}\\\\right)}{L} .\\n$$\\n\\nThis means that as seen from the position of the camera, the angular size of the image of the blur spot $\\\\theta_{B S}=$ $D_{I} /\\\\left(L-d_{S}\\\\right)$ equals to the angular size of the lens aperture $\\\\theta_{L}=D / L$. This fact is easily confirmed from the photo and is an important observation for two reasons. First, it means that based on the angular diameter of the image of the blur spot on the photo, it is impossible to figure out the distance $d_{0}$ (and hence, $d_{S}$ ). Second, it allows us to measure instead of the angular distance $\\\\theta$ between the centre of the lens and the centre of the image of the blur spot (as seen from the position of the cameraline), the respective distance between the edges of the respective circles. Equality of these two angular sizes is also easily seen from the geometric construction, see the figure. Ineed, consider blue lines $S A G$ and $S B F$ which arrive from the lamp $S$ to the edges of the blur spot. Image of point $F$, denoted by $J$, is now easily found as the intersection point of the ray $S B F$ with the ray $F O$ (passing through the centre of the lens); image $H$ of the other edge of the blur spot is found in the same way. From this construction, it becomes clear that the angular size of the image of the blur spot and the lens, as seen from the camera, are exactly equal, without any approximation. Due to the smallness of the distance $h$, these angular sizes remain almost constant when the observation point is moved from $S$ to $C$.\\n\\nGiven the images are approximately circular, the area ratio $k$ equals $\\\\left(D_{B S} / D\\\\right)^{2}$, or\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\pm \\\\sqrt{k}=\\\\frac{1}{f}\\\\left(d_{0}-\\\\frac{L f}{L-f}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{d_{0}}{f}-\\\\frac{L}{L-f}\\n$$\\n\\nIn the above equation, the \\\\pm sign represents the two cases where the paper sheet is behind or in front of the image of the lamp. From the graph, the ratio between the intensity of the brightest region and the dark region with $x>420$ is $10^{4.4-1.95} \\\\approx 282$, which equals $1 / k$. Then, $d_{0} / f$ can be found to be $\\\\pm \\\\sqrt{k}+1+f / L$, which gives two solutions $d_{0} / f \\\\approx 1.07$ and $d_{0} / f \\\\approx 0.95$. According to the experimental settings given in the problem text, $d_{0}$ is greater than $f$, and thus we obtain $d_{0} / f \\\\approx 1.07$ and $d_{S} \\\\approx 15.03 f \\\\approx 83 \\\\mathrm{~cm}$. This also verifies the hypothesis that $d_{0}-f \\\\ll f$.\\n\\nThe centre of the image of the blur spot is positioned at the height $h^{\\\\prime}=h \\\\frac{d_{S}}{L}$ above the direction to the centre of the lens (this expression from similarity of the triangles $O Q P$ and $O C S$ ) which means that $\\\\theta=h^{\\\\prime} /\\\\left(L-d_{S}\\\\right)$; meanwhile, the angular diameter of the lens $\\\\theta_{L}=D / L$. Therefore,\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{\\\\theta_{L}}=\\\\frac{h d_{S}}{D\\\\left(L-d_{S}\\\\right)}\\n$$\\n\\nThe ratio of the angular distances is easily measured from the figure as the ratio of the width $d_{c r}$ of the crescent-shaped second-brightest region to the diameter of the lense\\'s aperture $D^{\\\\prime}$ :\\n\\n$$\\nh=\\\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\\\prime}} \\\\frac{D\\\\left(L-d_{S}\\\\right)}{d_{S}}\\n$$\\n\\nBased on the graph, $d_{c r} \\\\approx 90$ pixels (midpoint of the blurry edge is around $x \\\\approx 120 \\\\mathrm{px}$, and the left edge of the aperture (in the graph) is at $x \\\\approx 30 \\\\mathrm{px}$; the right edge of the lens aperture is at $x \\\\approx 240 \\\\mathrm{px}$ corresponding to $D^{\\\\prime}=210 \\\\mathrm{px}$ and yielding $h \\\\approx 80 \\\\mathrm{~mm}$.\\n\\nRemark 1. In order to obtain the final answer with a reasonably good accuracy, it is not strictly speaking necessary to show that the apparent angular diameters of the lens and of the image of the blur spot are equal. All the other calculations remain the same, just one needs to match a circle with the circular segment of the visible edge of the blur spot, and measure directly $h^{\\\\prime}$, the distance between the centre of the lens and the centre of the blur spot, together with the diameter of the lens aperture $D^{\\\\prime}$ (see the small figure).\\n\\nRemark 2. The width of the crescent-shaped secondbrightest area can be also measured from the photo of\\n\\n\\n\\nthe lens with the required accuracy; however, measuring in pixels from the graph is more accurate.\\n\\nExplanation 1: Consider a small light source of luminance $\\\\mathcal{L}$ and surface area $S$ at a large distance $\\\\uparrow$ from the camera. The illuminance (the luminous flux per unit area) at the position of the camera is proportional to $\\\\uparrow^{-2}$ and so is the total luminous flux received by the whole sensor. Meanwhile, all this light energy is focused onto a small area $S^{\\\\prime}$ on the sensor - onto the image of the light source, and this area is also proportional to $\\\\uparrow^{-2}$. Therefore, the illuminance $I$ at the position of those sensor pixels which are covered by the image is independent of the distance $\\\\uparrow$.\\n\\nExplanation 2: Consider a very narrow cone of light of solid angle $\\\\omega$, starting from a very small area $S$ at the blur spot in a direction close to the surface normal, and carrying a total luminous flux $\\\\Phi$. Since the cone is narrow, this light beam is entirely caught by the lens at distance $d_{0}$, and focused onto the image of surface area $S^{\\\\prime}=S\\\\left(d_{S} / d_{0}\\\\right)^{2}$ at distance $d_{S}$ from the lens. The light rays of this beam traverse the focus and form another light cone of solid angle $\\\\omega^{\\\\prime}$ departing from the image. It is easy to see from similar triangles that $\\\\omega / \\\\omega^{\\\\prime}=\\\\left(d_{S} / d_{0}\\\\right)^{2}$. Then, the luminance of the image $\\\\mathcal{L}_{I}=\\\\Phi /\\\\left(S^{\\\\prime} \\\\omega^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)=\\\\Phi /(S \\\\omega)$, i.e. equal to the luminance of the blur spot.\\n\\n<img_4504>\\n\\n<img_4511>\\n\\nRemark 3: After having derived Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 and calculated $d_{0}$, the geometrical optics aspect can also be tackled by considering the image of the camera through the lens. The region bounded by the darkest ring in the image represents the area on the paper sheet that is observable by the camera through the lens. This area can be approximated by a circular spot with diameter $d$ (represented by $D^{\\\\prime}$ in the graph) depending negligibly on the size of the lens of the camera. Given small angles and that the lamp and the camera have equal distances to the lens, the bright spot on the paper sheet also has a diameter of $d$, which means $d=D \\\\sqrt{k}$. The angular distance between the lamp and the camera as seen from the center of the lens is $h /\\\\left(L-d_{0}\\\\right)$, and therefore, the distances between the two spots\\' centers, and also thus their boundaries (represented by $d_{c r}$ in the graph), on the paper sheet are $d_{0} h /\\\\left(L-d_{0}\\\\right)$. We then obtain an equivalent equation to that above:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{d_{0} h /\\\\left(L-d_{0}\\\\right)}{D \\\\sqrt{k}}=\\\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\\\prime}} \\\\Leftrightarrow h=\\\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\\\prime}} D \\\\sqrt{k} \\\\frac{L-d_{0}}{d_{0}} \\\\approx 80 \\\\mathrm{~mm} .\\n$$\\n\\nIt should be noted that, compared to the original analysis, the deviation in this calculation caused by $f / L$ (in finding $d_{0}$ and $d_{S}$ ) on the final result reduces drastically (from approximately $20 \\\\%$ down to approximately $1 \\\\%$ ). Even if $d_{0} \\\\approx f$ is assumed, the result is only deviated by approximately $7 \\\\%$.']",

    "response": "Let me help you solve this step by step.\n\n1) Let's understand what happens when an object falls with air resistance but doesn't reach terminal velocity:\n\n* Initially, the object experiences gravitational acceleration (g)\n* As it falls, air resistance gradually increases\n* Air resistance opposes motion, reducing the net acceleration\n* Since it doesn't reach terminal velocity, the acceleration never becomes zero\n\n2) Looking at the graphs:\n* Graph a: Shows constant acceleration equal to g (no air resistance effect)\n* Graph b: Shows decreasing acceleration starting from g (correct effect of air resistance)\n* Graph c: Shows increasing acceleration above g (physically impossible)\n* Graph d: Shows decreasing acceleration starting from g (similar to b)\n* Graph e: Shows increasing acceleration starting below g (physically impossible)\n\n3) Analysis:\n* Air resistance increases with velocity\n* This means the net acceleration must decrease over time\n* The acceleration must start at g and gradually decrease\n* Graphs b and d both show this behavior\n\n4) Final decision:\n* Between b and d, graph b shows a more realistic curve\n* The decrease in acceleration should be gradual, not linear\n* Therefore, graph b best represents this situation\n\nTherefore, \\boxed{b} is the correct answer."
