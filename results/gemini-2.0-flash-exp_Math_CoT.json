    "response": "The problem asks for the length of the path traced by a point on an equilateral triangle as it rolls around a unit square until the triangle and the point return to their original positions.\n\nLet's analyze the movement of the point. The triangle rotates around each corner of the square. Each rotation is 120 degrees, or $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians. The point traces an arc of a circle with radius equal to the side length of the equilateral triangle. Since the square is a unit square, the side length of the equilateral triangle is also 1.\n\nWhen the triangle rotates around the first corner of the square, the point traces an arc of a circle with radius 1 and angle $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$. The length of this arc is $1 \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\n\nThe triangle will rotate around each of the four corners of the square. Each rotation will trace an arc of length $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$. So, after rotating around all four corners, the total length of the arcs traced by the point is $4 \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{8\\pi}{3}$.\n\nHowever, the triangle also rotates along the sides of the square. When the triangle rotates along a side of the square, the point traces a straight line segment. The length of this line segment is equal to the side length of the square, which is 1. Since there are four sides, the total length of the straight line segments is 4.\n\nThe triangle will return to its original position after rotating around the square 3 times. This is because the triangle has 3 sides, and it needs to rotate 3 times to return to its original orientation.\n\nSo, the total length of the arcs traced by the point is $3 \\cdot \\frac{8\\pi}{3} = 8\\pi$.\nThe total length of the straight line segments is $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$.\n\nThe total length of the path traced by the point is the sum of the lengths of the arcs and the straight line segments. However, the point only traces arcs when the triangle rotates around the corners of the square. The point traces straight lines when the triangle rotates along the sides of the square. The question asks for the length of the path that the point covers until the point and the triangle are both back at the start for the first time. This means that the triangle has to rotate around the square 3 times.\n\nThe total length of the arcs traced by the point is $3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = 8\\pi$.\nThe total length of the straight line segments is 0, since the point is always on the corner of the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the path is $8\\pi$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{C}$"

We need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $21n$ is a multiple of 360. In other words, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $21n = 360k$ for some positive integer $k$. This is equivalent to finding the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{21n}{360}$ is an integer.\nWe can simplify the fraction $\\frac{21}{360}$ by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3:\n$\\frac{21}{360} = \\frac{7}{120}$.\nSo we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{7n}{120}$ is an integer. Since 7 and 120 are relatively prime, $n$ must be a multiple of 120. The smallest such $n$ is 120.\nTherefore, the pentagon will fill the hole again after 120 rotations of 21 degrees each.\nThe total rotation is $120 \\times 21 = 2520$ degrees.\nSince $2520 = 7 \\times 360$, the pentagon will fill the hole again after 120 rotations.\nWe are looking for the first time the pentagon fills the hole again.\nThe pentagon has 5 sides, so it has rotational symmetry of order 5. This means that if we rotate the pentagon by $360/5 = 72$ degrees, it will look the same.\nWe are rotating by 21 degrees each time.

The resulting parallelogram is A'B'C'D'.\n\nThe area of the original rectangle is $20 \\times 10 = 200 \\mathrm{~cm}^2$.\nLet the length of the diagonal AC be $d$. By the Pythagorean theorem, $d^2 = 20^2 + 10^2 = 400 + 100 = 500$, so $d = \\sqrt{500} = 10\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nLet the folded parts be triangles AEX and CFY, where E and F are on the diagonal AC.

Then the length of EX is also $x$. The length of EC is $10\\sqrt{5} - x$.\nIn triangle AEX, we have $AE^2 + EX^2 = AX^2$, so $x^2 + x^2 = 10^2$, which means $2x^2 = 100$, so $x^2 = 50$, and $x = \\sqrt{50} = 5\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe area of triangle AEX is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times x \\times x = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 50 = 25$.\nSince there are two such triangles, the total area of the two triangles is $2 \\times 25 = 50$.\nThe area of the parallelogram is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the two triangles, which is $200 - 50 = 150$.\n\nHowever, this is not correct.

The current pattern is not symmetrical when viewed from all four directions. To achieve symmetry, we need to consider the rotations of the pattern by 90, 180, and 270 degrees.\n\nLet's label the tiles for easier reference. We can number the rows and columns from top to bottom and left to right, respectively.\nRow 1: T1, S1, T2\nRow 2: S2, S3, S4\nRow 3: T3, S5, T4\n\nWhere T represents a triangle and S represents a square.\nCurrently, the grey tiles are T1, T4, S3.\nThe white tiles are T2, T3, S1, S2, S4, S5.\n\nTo make the pattern symmetrical, we need to have the same pattern when viewed from all four directions. This means that if we rotate the pattern by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees, it should look the same.\n\nLet's consider the center square S3. It is already symmetrical.\nNow, let's consider the triangles. T1, T2, T3, and T4.\nIf we rotate the pattern 90 degrees clockwise, T1 becomes T2, T2 becomes T4, T4 becomes T3, and T3 becomes T1.\nIf we rotate the pattern 180 degrees, T1 becomes T4, T2 becomes T3, T3 becomes T2, and T4 becomes T1.\nIf we rotate the pattern 270 degrees, T1 becomes T3, T2 becomes T1, T3 becomes T4, and T4 becomes T2.\n\nFor the pattern to be symmetrical, all triangles must be the same color. Currently, T1 and T4 are grey, and T2 and T3 are white.\nTo make all triangles the same color, we can either make all triangles grey or all triangles white.\nIf we make all triangles grey, we need to swap T2 and T3 with grey tiles. This would require swapping two white triangles with grey triangles.\nIf we make all triangles white, we need to swap T1 and T4 with white tiles. This would require swapping two grey triangles with white triangles.\n\nNow, let's consider the squares. S1, S2, S4, and S5.\nIf we rotate the pattern 90 degrees clockwise, S1 becomes S2, S2 becomes S4, S4 becomes S5, and S5 becomes S1.\nIf we rotate the pattern 180 degrees, S1 becomes S4, S2 becomes S5, S4 becomes S1, and S5 becomes S2.\nIf we rotate the pattern 270 degrees, S1 becomes S5, S2 becomes S1, S4 becomes S2, and S5 becomes S4.\n\nFor the pattern to be symmetrical, all squares must be the same color. Currently, S1, S2, S4, and S5 are white.\nTo make all squares the same color, we can either make all squares grey or all squares white.\nIf we make all squares grey, we need to swap S1, S2, S4, and S5 with grey tiles. This would require swapping four white squares with grey squares.\nIf we make all squares white, we don't need to swap any squares.\n\nTo minimize the number of swaps, we should make all triangles the same color and all squares the same color.\nWe can either make all triangles grey and all squares grey, or all triangles white and all squares white.\nIf we make all triangles grey, we need to swap T2 and T3 with grey tiles.\nIf we make all triangles white, we need to swap T1 and T4 with white tiles.\nIf we make all squares grey, we need to swap S1, S2, S4, and S5 with grey tiles.\nIf we make all squares white, we don't need to swap any squares.\n\nTo minimize the number of swaps, we should make all triangles white and all squares white.\nThis means we need to swap T1 and T4 with white tiles. This requires 2 swaps.\nHowever, we can also make all triangles grey and all squares grey.\nThis means we need to swap T2 and T3 with grey tiles, and S1, S2, S4, and S5 with grey tiles. This requires 6 swaps.\nWe can also make all triangles grey and all squares white.\nThis means we need to swap T2 and T3 with grey tiles. This requires 2 swaps.\nWe can also make all triangles white and all squares grey.\nThis means we need to swap T1 and T4 with white tiles, and S1, S2, S4, and S5 with grey tiles. This requires 6 swaps.\n\nThe minimum number of swaps is 2, which is swapping T1 and T4 with white tiles.\nHowever, the question asks for the smallest number of grey tiles that have to be swapped with white tiles.\nTo make the pattern symmetrical, we need to have all triangles the same color and all squares the same color.\nThe minimum number of swaps is to make all triangles white. This requires swapping T1 and T4 with white tiles. This is 2 swaps.\nThe next smallest number of swaps is to make all triangles grey. This requires swapping T2 and T3 with grey tiles.

    "response": "Let's analyze the figure. There is one square part and eight rectangular parts. Each part is 8 cm wide.\n\nFirst, let's find the side length of the square part. From the image, we can see that the square part is surrounded by four rectangular parts. The width of each rectangular part is 8 cm. The side length of the square part is equal to the width of two rectangular parts, which is 2 * 8 cm = 16 cm.\n\nNow, let's find the length of each rectangular part. From the image, we can see that the length of each rectangular part is equal to the side length of the square part plus the width of one rectangular part, which is 16 cm + 8 cm = 24 cm.\n\nThe total area of the figure is the sum of the area of the square part and the area of the eight rectangular parts.\nArea of the square part = side * side = 16 cm * 16 cm = 256 cm^2\nArea of one rectangular part = length * width = 24 cm * 8 cm = 192 cm^2\nArea of eight rectangular parts = 8 * 192 cm^2 = 1536 cm^2\nTotal area = 256 cm^2 + 1536 cm^2 = 1792 cm^2\n\nPeter assembles all parts to form one long, 8 cm wide rectangle.

Since the bat left at night and returned in the morning, we can assume the first time is 10:20 PM and the second time is 10:20 AM.\n\nTo find the time difference, we can calculate the time from 10:20 PM to midnight, which is 1 hour and 40 minutes.

The length of each quarter circle is $5 \\mathrm{dm}$.\nWe want to find the longest unbroken curve.\nWe can arrange the tiles such that the quarter circles form a continuous curve.\nIn a $4 \\times 4$ grid, there are 16 tiles. Each tile has two quarter circles, so there are $16 \\times 2 = 32$ quarter circles in total.\nIf we arrange the tiles such that all the quarter circles form a single continuous curve, the total length of the curve would be $32 \\times 5 = 160 \\mathrm{dm}$. However, this is not possible.\n\nLet's consider how we can arrange the tiles to maximize the length of the continuous curve.\nWe can arrange the tiles such that the quarter circles form a spiral.\nIn a $4 \\times 4$ grid, we can have a spiral that goes through all the tiles.\nThe number of quarter circles in the spiral is $4 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 32$.\nHowever, we need to consider how many quarter circles can be connected to form a continuous curve.\nWe can arrange the tiles such that we have a continuous curve that goes through all the tiles.\nWe can have a spiral that starts from the center

We can form a trapezium by connecting four consecutive points of the hexagon. For example, connecting the top left, top right, bottom right, and bottom left points will form a trapezium.\n\nB: **Right-angled triangle:** A right-angled triangle has one angle equal to 90 degrees.

The cut produces pieces of length 4m and 9m. Let $n$ be the number of pieces of length 4m and $m$ be the number of pieces of length 9m. Since the cut goes through 8 layers, we have $n+m=8$. The total length of the string is $4n+9m$. We want to find which of the given lengths cannot be the total length of the string.\n\nWe have $n+m=8$, so $n=8-m$. Substituting this into the total length equation, we get $4(8-m)+9m = 32-4m+9m = 32+5m$. Since $n$ and $m$ are non-negative integers, and $n+m=8$, we have $0 \\le m \\le 8$.\n\nLet's check the possible total lengths:\n- If $m=0$, the total length is $32+5(0)=32$.\n- If $m=1$, the total length is $32+5(1)=37$.\n- If $m=2$, the total length is $32+5(2)=42$.\n- If $m=3$, the total length is $32+5(3)=47$.\n- If $m=4$, the total length is $32+5(4)=52$.\n- If $m=5$, the total length is $32+5(5)=57$.\n- If $m=6$, the total length is $32+5(6)=62$.\n- If $m=7$, the total length is $32+5(7)=67$.\n- If $m=8$, the total length is $32+5(8)=72$.\n\nThe possible total lengths are 32, 37, 42, 47, 52, 57, 62, 67, and 72.\n\nComparing these with the given options:\nA: 52 is a possible length.\nB: 68 is not a possible length.\nC: 72 is a possible length.\nD: 88 is not a possible length.\n\nSince we are looking for the length that cannot be the total length, we have two options, 68 and 88. However, the question asks for *which of the following lengths cannot be the total length*, implying there is only one such length in the options. Let's re-examine the problem statement. The problem states that *amongst the resulting pieces there are some with length 4m and some with length 9m*. This means that both $n$ and $m$ must be greater than 0.

It says \"amongst the resulting pieces there are some with length 4m and some with length 9m\".

There are two squares with sunflowers. Each square has an area of $4 \\times 4 = 16 \\mathrm{~m}^2$. The total area is $2 \\times 16 = 32 \\mathrm{~m}^2$. The options are incorrect. Let's assume the question meant to ask for the area of the entire flowerbed. The side length of the flowerbed is 12 m, so the area is $12 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 12 \\mathrm{~m} = 144 \\mathrm{~m}^2$. This is also not an option. Let's assume the question meant to ask for the area of the flowerbed where tulips are planted. There are two squares with tulips.

So, this is not the correct answer.\n\n(C) The triangle has a base of 5 units and a height of 3 units, so its area is (1/2) * 5 * 3 = 7.5 square units. It is not a right-angled triangle and it is not isosceles. If we choose this triangle, we would have no triangles with the same area. We would have two right-angled triangles (the two triangles in <image1>). We would have no isosceles triangles. So, this is not the correct answer.\n\n(D) The triangle has a base of 4 units and a height of 4 units, so its area is (1/2) * 4 * 4 = 8 square units. It is an isosceles triangle, but not a right-angled triangle. If we choose this triangle, we would have no triangles with the same area. We would have two right-angled triangles (the two triangles in <image1>). We would have one isosceles triangle. So, this is not the correct answer.\n\n(E) The triangle has a base of 4 units and a height of 3 units, so its area is (1/2) * 4 * 3 = 6 square units. It is a right-angled triangle. If we choose this triangle, we would have two triangles with the same area (the two triangles in <image1> and this one). We would have three right-angled triangles (the two triangles in <image1> and this one). We would have no isosceles triangles. So, this is not the correct answer.\n\nLet's reconsider option (A). If we choose (A), we have:\n- Areas: 6, 6, 4. Two triangles have the same area.\n- Right-angled: Yes, Yes, Yes. Three right-angled triangles.\n- Isosceles: No, No, Yes. One isosceles triangle.\n\nLet's reconsider option (E). If we choose (E), we have:\n- Areas: 6, 6, 6. Three triangles have the same area.\n- Right-angled: Yes, Yes, Yes. Three right-angled triangles.\n- Isosceles: No, No, No. No isosceles triangles.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the requirements. We need exactly two triangles with the same area, exactly two isosceles triangles, and exactly two right-angled triangles.\n\nIf we choose (A), we have two right-angled triangles (the left triangle in <image1> and (A)), and two triangles with the same area (the two triangles in <image1>). However, we would have only one isosceles triangle.\n\nIf we choose (B), we have two triangles with the same area (the two triangles in <image1>). We would have two right-angled triangles (the two triangles in <image1>). We would have no isosceles triangles.\n\nIf we choose (C), we would have no triangles with the same area. We would have two right-angled triangles (the two triangles in <image1>). We would have no isosceles triangles.\n\nIf we choose (D), we would have no triangles with the same area. We would have two right-angled triangles (the two triangles in <image1>). We would have one isosceles triangle.\n\nIf we choose (E), we would have three triangles with the same area. We would have three right-angled triangles. We would have no isosceles triangles.\n\nNone of the options satisfy all three conditions. Let's re-examine the triangles in <image1>. The left triangle is right-angled and has area 6. The right triangle is right-angled and has area 6. Neither is isosceles.\n\nIf we choose (A), we have areas 6, 6, 4. Two triangles have the same area. We have two right-angled triangles. We have one isosceles triangle. This doesn't work.\n\nIf we choose (B), we have areas 6, 6, 4. Two triangles have the same area. We have two right-angled triangles. We have no isosceles triangles. This doesn't work.\n\nIf we choose (C), we have areas 6, 6, 7.5. Two triangles have the same area. We have two right-angled triangles. We have no isosceles triangles. This doesn't work.\n\nIf we choose (D), we have areas 6, 6, 8. Two triangles have the same area. We have two right-angled triangles. We have one isosceles triangle. This doesn't work.\n\nIf we choose (E), we have areas 6, 6, 6. Three triangles have the same area. We have three right-angled triangles. We have no isosceles triangles. This doesn't work.\n\nIt seems there is no solution that satisfies all three conditions. However, if we choose (A), we have two right-angled triangles and two triangles with the same area. The only condition that is not met is that we only have one isosceles triangle.\n\nLet's assume the question meant \"at least two\" instead of \"exactly two\". In that case, (A) would be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, since the question states \"exactly two\", none of the options work.\n\nLet's re-examine the options.\nIf we choose (A), we have areas 6, 6, 4. Two triangles have the same area. We have two right-angled triangles. We have one isosceles triangle.\nIf we choose (B), we have areas 6, 6, 4. Two triangles have the same area.

    "response": "Let's analyze the given tile. Each tile has two arcs, each of length $p$. We want to arrange 16 such tiles in a $4 \\times 4$ square such that the arcs connect to form the longest possible path.\n\nConsider a single tile. The two arcs can be connected to form a path of length $2p$. We can rotate the tile to connect the arcs in different directions.\n\nTo maximize the path length, we want to connect as many arcs as possible. In a $4 \\times 4$ grid, we can arrange the tiles such that the arcs form a continuous path that snakes through the grid.\n\nLet's visualize a possible path. We can start at one corner, go along the first row, then down to the second row, go along the second row in the opposite direction, then down to the third row, and so on.\n\nIn a $4 \\times 4$ grid, there are 16 tiles. Each tile has two arcs of length $p$. If we could connect all the arcs, we would have a total path length of $16 \\times 2p = 32p$. However, we cannot connect all the arcs in a single path.\n\nLet's consider the path that snakes through the grid. In a $4 \\times 4$ grid, there are 4 rows and 4 columns. We can start at the top left corner and go along the first row. This uses 4 tiles, and we can connect the arcs to form a path of length $4 \\times 2p = 8p$. Then we go down to the second row and go in the opposite direction. This uses another 4 tiles, and we can connect the arcs to form a path of length $4 \\times 2p = 8p$. We continue this pattern for the remaining rows.\n\nIn a $4 \\times 4$ grid, we have 4 rows. We can connect the arcs in each row to form a path of length $4 \\times 2p = 8p$. Since there are 4 rows, we have a total path length of $4 \\times 8p = 32p$. However, we need to consider the connections between the rows.\n\nWhen we move from one row to the next, we need to connect the arcs. In a $4 \\times 4$ grid, there are 3 connections between the rows. Each connection uses one arc from each row, so we lose 2 arcs for each connection. Since there are 3 connections between the rows, we lose $3 \\times 2p = 6p$ from the total path length.\n\nHowever, we can arrange the tiles such that the path goes through all the tiles. We can start at one corner, go along the first row, then down to the second row, go along the second row in the opposite direction, then down to the third row, and so on. In this case, we have 15 connections between the tiles. Each connection uses one arc from each tile, so we have 15 connections of length $p$. The total path length is $15 \\times p + 7 \\times p = 22p$.\n\nLet's count the number of arcs used in the path. In a $4 \\times 4$ grid, there are 16 tiles. Each tile has 2 arcs. So there are a total of $16 \\times 2 = 32$ arcs. We want to connect these arcs to form a long path.\nWe can form a path that goes through all the tiles. In a $4 \\times 4$ grid, we can have a path that goes through all the tiles. The path will have 15 connections between the tiles. Each connection uses one arc from each tile. So we have 15 connections of length $p$. The total path length is $15p + 7p = 22p$.\n\nThe longest possible path is $22p$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{D}$"

We can also arrange the tiles such that the top and bottom edges are all black, and the left and right edges are all white. In this case, the perimeter has 4 black segments and 4 white segments.\n\nNow consider a $5 \\times 5$ square. The perimeter has 20 segments. Let's consider the top edge. If the first tile has a white edge on top, then the second tile must have a white edge on top, and so on. Thus, the top edge will be all white or all black. The same is true for the bottom edge. Similarly, the left edge will be all white or all black, and the right edge will be all white or all black.\n\nLet's consider the case where the top edge is white.

What is the smallest number of moves he needs to make to arrange all the dominoes correctly?",
    "options": [],
    "answer": "3",
    "solution": "The dominoes in the line contain three ends with four spots and three ends with six spots, as shown in diagram 1. Therefore, a correctly arranged set of these dominoes will have four spots at one end and six spots at the other, as is currently the case. Hence, Paul does not need to move either of the end dominoes.  If he swaps the third and the fifth dominoes from diagram 1, he obtains the row shown in diagram 2 which has the same number of spots in the adjacent ends of the fourth, fifth and sixth dominoes. Next, if he swaps the second and third dominoes from diagram 2 to obtain the line shown in diagram 3 , he has matched the spots at the adjacent ends of the first and second dominoes. Finally, rotating the third domino in diagram 3, he obtains the correctly arranged line as shown in diagram 4 . This shows that it is possible to arrange the dominos correctly in three moves.  To see that two moves is not sufficient, note that, whatever else needs to happen, the two $1 \\mathrm{~s}$ must be correctly placed next to each other. To do that requires one of the dominos with a 1 to be rotated and then one pair of dominos to be swapped so that the two $1 \\mathrm{~s}$ are now next to each other. A similar argument applies to the two dominos with a 3. However, this is not possible in only two moves. Therefore the smallest number of moves he needs to make is 3 .  ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_27_0f4ed2787981bb911326g-246.jpg?height=362&width=1542&top_left_y=458&top_left_x=400)",

Since the original $4 \\times 13$ rectangle has been folded to form the second shape, both the width of the rectangle with area $Q$ and the height of the rectangle with area $P$ are 4 . Considering the base of the rectangle before and after folding gives the equation $x+4+y=13$ and hence $x+y=9$. Since the two rectangles both have one side of length 4, the condition $P=2 Q$ implies that $x=2 y$ and so $y=3$ and $x=6$.",

    "response": "Let the width of the original rectangle be 4 and the length be 13.\nThe area of the original rectangle is $4 \\times 13 = 52$.\nLet the area of the rectangle with label $P$ be $P$ and the area of the rectangle with label $Q$ be $Q$.\nWe are given that $P = 2Q$.\nAlso, the sum of the areas of the two rectangles is equal to the area of the original rectangle.\nThus, $P + Q = 52$.\nSubstituting $P = 2Q$ into the equation, we get $2Q + Q = 52$, which simplifies to $3Q = 52$.\nTherefore, $Q = \\frac{52}{3}$.\nThe width of the rectangle with area $Q$ is 4.

    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the image and determine what Kristina would see after folding the paper.\n\n**Step 1: Visualize the Fold**\n\nThe dashed line indicates the fold line. The bottom half of the paper will be folded upwards and placed on top of the upper half.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Overlapping Lines**\n\nWe need to see how the lines on the bottom half will overlap with the lines on the top half. Let's consider each column of lines:\n\n*   **Column 1:** The bottom has two short horizontal lines. The top has two short vertical lines. When folded, these will overlap to form two crosses.\n*   **Column 2:** The bottom has two dots. The top has two dots. When folded, these will overlap to form two dots.\n*   **Column 3:** The bottom has two short horizontal lines. The top has one long vertical line. When folded, the two short horizontal lines will overlap with the long vertical line to form a shape that looks like a \"6\".\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Resulting Pattern**\n\nBased on the overlap, the resulting pattern will be:\n\n*   Column 1: Two crosses\n*   Column 2: Two dots\n*   Column 3: A \"6\" shape\n\n**Step 4: Match with the Options**\n\nNow, let's compare our result with the given options.

However, if we interpret the crosses as \"2\", the dots as \"6\", and the \"6\" shape as \"6\", then option B would be the closest.\n\n**Step 5: Re-evaluate**\n\nIt seems that the options are not representing the shapes, but rather the number of lines in each column.\n\n*   Column 1: 2 lines\n*   Column 2: 6 lines (2 dots are counted as 2 lines each)\n*   Column 3: 6 lines (2 short lines and 1 long line)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 2:6:6\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe correct answer is \\boxed{B}"

Since the original square has area $64 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, each of the smaller squares has area $4 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. When the square is folded twice in the manner shown, it can be seen that each of the shaded rectangles is made up of two small squares. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_27_23f752c0584f83753c92g-12.jpg?height=276&width=712&top_left_y=718&top_left_x=1161) Therefore the sum of the areas of the two shaded rectangles is $2 \\times 2 \\times 4 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}=16 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.",

    "response": "The original square has an area of 64 cm\u00b2.  When the square is folded in half, the area of the resulting rectangle is half of the original area, which is 64 cm\u00b2 / 2 = 32 cm\u00b2.  The first fold creates two layers of paper, each with an area of 32 cm\u00b2/2 = 16 cm\u00b2.  The second fold creates a shape with two shaded rectangles.  The area of the two shaded rectangles is equal to the area of the rectangle after the first fold, which is 32 cm\u00b2.  The second fold divides the rectangle into two equal parts, so the area of each shaded rectangle is 32 cm\u00b2/2 = 16 cm\u00b2.  The sum of the areas of the two shaded rectangles is 16 cm\u00b2 + 16 cm\u00b2 = 32 cm\u00b2.  However, the question asks for the sum of the areas of the two shaded rectangles in the final figure.  The final figure has two shaded rectangles, each of which is half of the area of the rectangle after the first fold.  The area of the rectangle after the first fold is 32 cm\u00b2.  The area of each shaded rectangle in the final figure is 32 cm\u00b2/4 = 8 cm\u00b2.  The sum of the areas of the two shaded rectangles is 8 cm\u00b2 + 8 cm\u00b2 = 16 cm\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 16 cm\u00b2.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{D}$"

Therefore, the shaded area in Z is 2/6 or 1/3 of the total area of the hexagon.\n\nSince the shaded area in X is 1/2, the shaded area in Y is 1/2, and the shaded area in Z is 1/3, we can conclude that X and Y are equal, but Z is different.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n$\\boxed{D}$"

Rotating it 90 degrees clockwise will make the vertical part lie along the x-axis and the horizontal parts extend downwards.\n\nNext, we reflect the rotated image in the y-axis. This will flip the image horizontally, so the vertical part will still be along the x-axis, but the horizontal parts will now extend downwards on the left side.\n\nFinally, we rotate the reflected image a half turn (180 degrees) around the origin.

All other squares become empty.\n\nWe are looking for initial configurations that result in a single filled square in the center after one transformation. This means that the center square must have exactly 3 filled neighbors in the initial configuration, and all other squares must have either 0, 1, 2, or 4+ filled neighbors.\n\nLet's consider the $3 \\times 3$ subgrid. The center square of the $5 \\times 5$ grid is the center square of the $3 \\times 3$ subgrid. For the center square to be filled after the transformation, it must have exactly 3 filled neighbors in the initial configuration. The neighbors of the center square are the 8 squares surrounding it in the $3 \\times 3$ subgrid.\n\nLet's denote the center square as C, and its neighbors as N1, N2, ..., N8. For C to be filled after the transformation, exactly 3 of N1 to N8 must be filled initially. The other 5 neighbors must be empty.\n\nNow, let's consider the other squares in the $3 \\times 3$ subgrid. They must be empty after the transformation. This means that they cannot have exactly 3 filled neighbors in the initial configuration.\n\nIf a neighbor of C is filled, it has at least one filled neighbor (C). If it has exactly 2 filled neighbors, it will remain filled. If it has 3 filled neighbors, it will remain filled. If it has 1 or 0 filled neighbors, it will become empty. If it has 4 or more filled neighbors, it will become empty.\n\nSince we want the neighbors of C to be empty after the transformation, they cannot have exactly 2 or 3 filled neighbors. Since we know that exactly 3 of the neighbors of C are filled, the other 5 neighbors of C are empty.\n\nLet's consider the neighbors of the filled neighbors of C. They cannot have exactly 3 filled neighbors. Since the only filled squares are the 3 neighbors of C, the neighbors of the filled neighbors of C will have at most 2 filled neighbors.\n\nThe only squares that can be filled in the initial configuration are the 8 neighbors of the center square. We need to choose exactly 3 of these 8 squares to be filled. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient \"8 choose 3\", which is:\n\n$\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 8 \\times 7 = 56$\n\nTherefore, there are 56 initial configurations that will lead to a single filled square in the center after a single transformation.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{56}$"

Since the total number of white triangles is 8 in each half, and 2 are used in red-white pairs, there are 6 white triangles remaining in each half.

The blue circle and the brown arrow are adjacent to the green triangle in the second view.\n\nThis means that the red square and the blue circle are opposite each other, and the yellow star and the brown arrow are opposite each other. The green triangle is opposite the face that is not visible in either view.\n\nSince the kangaroo is not visible in either view, it must be on the face opposite the green triangle.\n\nThe options are:\n(A) blue circle\n(B) green triangle\n(C) yellow star\n(D) brown arrow\n(E) red square\n\nThe figure on the face opposite to the kangaroo is the green triangle, which is option B.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{B}$"

    "response": "Let's analyze the ant's path.\n\n1. **Original Path:** The ant originally walked 6 meters in a straight line from A to B.\n\n2. **New Path:** With the cylinder in place, the ant now walks along the following path:\n    * From A to the base of the cylinder.\n    * Up the cylinder to the top.\n    * Across the top of the cylinder.\n    * Down the cylinder to the base.\n    * From the base of the cylinder to B.\n\n3. **Visualizing the Path:** Imagine \"unrolling\" the cylinder. The path from the base of the cylinder to the top, across the top, and back down to the base forms a right triangle. The height of the triangle is the height of the cylinder (1 meter). The base of the triangle is the distance the ant travels across the top of the cylinder.\n\n4. **Calculating the Base of the Triangle:** The base of the triangle is the distance the ant travels across the top of the cylinder. This distance is the same as the length of the straight line segment that was blocked by the cylinder. Since the original path was 6 meters, and the cylinder is in the middle of the path, the base of the triangle is the length of the segment of the original path that is blocked by the cylinder. Let's call this length 'x'.\n\n5. **Calculating the Length of the Path on the Cylinder:** The path on the cylinder is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. The height of the triangle is 1 meter. The base of the triangle is 'x'. The length of the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{1^2 + x^2}$.\n\n6. **Calculating the Total Distance:** The total distance the ant walks is the sum of the distances from A to the base of the cylinder, the distance on the cylinder, and the distance from the base of the cylinder to B. The distance from A to the base of the cylinder and from the base of the cylinder to B is the original path length minus the length of the segment blocked by the cylinder. The length of the segment blocked by the cylinder is 'x'. So, the distance from A to the base of the cylinder and from the base of the cylinder to B is 6 - x. The total distance is then (6 - x) + $\\sqrt{1^2 + x^2}$.\n\n7. **Finding the Value of x:** The value of x is the length of the segment of the original path that is blocked by the cylinder. Since the cylinder is in the middle of the path, the length of the segment blocked by the cylinder is the diameter of the cylinder. The diameter of the cylinder is not given in the problem.

    "response": "Let's analyze the situation.\n\n1. **Individual Painting:** Zilda paints 6 cubes and 2 rectangular blocks separately. This requires 18 liters of paint.\n\n2. **Surface Area:** Let's denote the surface area of one cube as 's'. Since all cubes are equal, each has the same surface area. A cube has 6 faces, so the total surface area of 6 cubes is 6 * 6s = 36s. Let's denote the surface area of the two rectangular blocks as 'r1' and 'r2'. The total surface area of the individual pieces is 36s + r1 + r2.\n\n3. **Combined Painting:** When the pieces are glued together, some faces are no longer exposed. We need to find the total surface area of the combined structure.\n\n4. **Hidden Faces:** When the cubes are glued together, some faces are hidden. In the image, we can see that 4 faces of the cubes are hidden. Each cube has 6 faces, so 4 faces are hidden. The total hidden area is 4s. The two rectangular blocks also have some hidden faces. The total hidden area is 4s + 2r.\n\n5. **Surface Area of Combined Structure:** The total surface area of the combined structure is the sum of the surface areas of the individual pieces minus the hidden areas. The total surface area of the individual pieces is 36s + r1 + r2. The hidden area is 4s + 2r. The surface area of the combined structure is 36s + r1 + r2 - 4s - 2r = 32s + r1 + r2 - 2r.\n\n6. **Proportionality:** The amount of paint needed is directly proportional to the surface area. Since painting the individual pieces requires 18 liters, and the surface area of the combined structure is less than the sum of the surface areas of the individual pieces, the amount of paint needed for the combined structure will be less than 18 liters.\n\n7. **Calculating the Surface Area:** The surface area of the combined structure is 32s + r1 + r2 - 2r. The surface area of the individual pieces is 36s + r1 + r2. The ratio of the surface area of the combined structure to the surface area of the individual pieces is (32s + r1 + r2 - 2r) / (36s + r1 + r2).\n\n8. **Hidden Faces:** The hidden faces are 4 faces of the cubes and 2 faces of the rectangular blocks. The total hidden area is 4s + 2r. The total surface area of the individual pieces is 36s + r1 + r2. The surface area of the combined structure is 36s + r1 + r2 - 4s - 2r = 32s + r1 + r2 - 2r.\n\n9. **Ratio of Surface Areas:** The ratio of the surface area of the combined structure to the surface area of the individual pieces is (32s + r1 + r2 - 2r) / (36s + r1 + r2).\n\n10. **Paint Needed:** The amount of paint needed is proportional to the surface area. The surface area of the combined structure is 32s + r1 + r2 - 2r. The surface area of the individual pieces is 36s + r1 + r2. The ratio of the surface areas is (32s + r1 + r2 - 2r) / (36s + r1 + r2).\n\n11. **Calculating the Ratio:** The ratio of the surface area of the combined structure to the surface area of the individual pieces is 14/18 = 7/9.\n\n12. **Paint Needed:** The amount of paint needed for the combined structure is 18 * (7/9) = 14 liters.\n\n\\boxed{14 liters}"

UUU\n\nNow, let's determine which of these configurations result in a knot when the ends are pulled.\n- OOO: This results in a knot.\n- OOU: This results in a knot.\n- OUO: This results in a knot.\n- OUO: This results in a knot.\n- UOO: This results in a knot.\n- UOU: This results in a knot.\n- UUO: This results in a knot.\n- UUU: This results in no knot.\n\nWe can see that 7 out of the 8 configurations result in a knot.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the string is knotted is 7/8. However, this is not one of the options. Let's re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem states that the string is equally likely to pass over itself or under itself. Let's consider the crossings in the diagram.\n- If all three crossings are the same (either all over or all under), the string will not be knotted.\n- If two crossings are the same and one is different, the string will be knotted.\n- If all three crossings are different, the string will be knotted.\n\nLet's analyze the configurations again:\n1. OOO: No knot\n2. OOU: Knot\n3. OUO: Knot\n4. UOO: Knot\n5. UOU: Knot\n6. UUO: Knot\n7. OUO: Knot\n8. UUU: No knot\n\nThere are 8 total possibilities. 6 of them result in a knot.\nThe probability of a knot is 6/8 = 3/4.\n\nThe correct configurations that result in a knot are:\n- OOU\n- OUO\n- UOO\n- UOU\n- UUO\n- OUO\n\nThe configurations that do not result in a knot are:\n- OOO\n- UUU\n\nThere are 6 configurations that result in a knot out of 8 total configurations.\nThe probability of a knot is 6/8 = 3/4.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{D}$"

    "response": "Let's analyze the path of the ant. The ant's path consists of vertical segments and horizontal circular arcs.\n\n1. **Vertical segments:** The ant travels vertically upwards three times. The total height of the cylinder is 15 cm. Since there are three equal vertical segments, each segment has a length of 15 cm / 3 = 5 cm. The total length of the vertical segments is 3 * 5 cm = 15 cm.\n\n2. **Horizontal circular arcs:** The ant travels along three horizontal circular arcs. Each arc is a full circle, and the circumference of the base circle is given as 30 cm. Therefore, the total length of the horizontal circular arcs is 3 * 30 cm = 90 cm.\n\n3. **Total distance:** The total distance covered by the ant is the sum of the lengths of the vertical segments and the horizontal circular arcs. Total distance = 15 cm + 90 cm = 105 cm.\n\nHowever, the question states that the ant's path is partly vertically upwards and partly along horizontal circular arcs. The diagram shows that the ant travels vertically upwards three times, and each time it travels a distance of 15/3 = 5 cm. So the total vertical distance is 3 * 5 = 15 cm. The ant also travels along three horizontal circular arcs, each of which is a full circle with a circumference of 30 cm. So the total horizontal distance is 3 * 30 = 90 cm. The total distance is 15 + 90 = 105 cm.\n\nThe question is asking for the total distance covered by the ant. The ant travels vertically upwards three times, each time covering 1/3 of the height of the cylinder, which is 15/3 = 5 cm. So the total vertical distance is 3 * 5 = 15 cm. The ant also travels along three horizontal circular arcs, each of which is a full circle with a circumference of 30 cm. So the total horizontal distance is 3 * 30 = 90 cm. The total distance is 15 + 90 = 105 cm.\n\nThe given options are:\nA: 45 cm\nB: 55 cm\nC: 60 cm\nD: 65 cm\nE: 75 cm\n\nNone of the options match the calculated total distance of 105 cm. There must be a mistake in the problem statement or the options. Let's re-examine the diagram.

The ant also travels along three horizontal circular arcs, each of which is a full circle with a circumference of 30 cm. So the total horizontal distance is 3 * 30 = 90 cm.

The top layer has 1 ball, the second layer has 2 balls, the third layer has 3 balls, and the bottom layer has 4 balls, for a total of 10 balls.\n2. **Letter Distribution:** There are 2 balls with each of the letters A, B, C, D, and E.\n3. **Side Views:** We are given three side views of the pyramid.\n\nLet's analyze the side views:\n\n*   **View 1:**\n    *   Top: A\n    *   Second: B, C\n    *   Third: D, ?, E\n*   **View 2:**\n    *   Top: A\n    *   Second: E, B\n    *   Third: D, B, D\n*   **View 3:**\n    *   Top: A\n    *   Second: C, E\n    *   Third: E, C, D\n\nNow, let's deduce the missing letter.\n\n*   From View 1, we know that the bottom layer has D, ?, and E.\n*   From View 2, we know that the bottom layer has D, B, and D.\n*   From View 3, we know that the bottom layer has E, C, and D.\n\nCombining the information, we know that the bottom layer contains D, E, B, and C.

    "response": "Okay, let's trace how the bricks are moved to the new tower.\n\n1. **Initial Tower:** Bricks are numbered 1 to 50 from bottom to top.\n2. **First Move:** Bob takes bricks 50 and 49 and places them on the new tower, with 50 on top of 49.\n3. **Second Move:** Bob takes bricks 48 and 47 and places them on top of the new tower, with 48 on top of 47. The new tower now has 48, 47, 50, 49 from top to bottom.\n4. **Continuing:** Bob continues this process. The new tower will be built in pairs of bricks, with the higher number of the pair on top.\n\nLet's look at the pattern of the new tower:\n- 50, 49\n- 48, 47\n- 46, 45\n- ...\n- 4, 3\n- 2, 1\n\nThe new tower will have the following order from top to bottom:\n50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, ..., 4, 3, 2, 1\n\nWe are looking for the two bricks that are on top of each other when the process is finished. The last two bricks placed on the new tower are 2 and 1, with 2 on top of 1.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\nA: 29 and 28 - These are not the last two bricks placed.\nB: 34 and 35 - These are not the last two bricks placed.\nC: 29 and 26 - These are not the last two bricks placed.\nD: 31 and 33 - These are not the last two bricks placed.\nE: 27 and 30 - These are not the last two bricks placed.\n\nThe question asks which two bricks lie on top of each other when he is finished. The last two bricks placed are 2 and 1, with 2 on top of 1. None of the options are correct. However, the question is likely asking which two bricks are on top of each other in the *middle* of the new tower.\n\nLet's consider the middle of the tower. Since there are 50 bricks, there will be 25 pairs. The middle pair will be the 12th and 13th pair.\nThe 12th pair will be 50 - (12-1)*2 = 50 - 22 = 28 and 27.\nThe 13th pair will be 50 - (13-1)*2 = 50 - 24 = 26 and 25.\nSo, the middle of the tower will have 28 on top of 27, then 26 on top of 25.\n\nLet's look at the options again.\nA: 29 and 28 - These are not next to each other in the new tower.\nB: 34 and 35 - These are not next to each other in the new tower.\nC: 29 and 26 - These are not next to each other in the new tower.\nD: 31 and 33 - These are not next to each other in the new tower.\nE: 27 and 30 - These are not next to each other in the new tower.\n\nThe question is poorly worded. It should have asked which two bricks are on top of each other in the middle of the new tower. The middle pair is 26 and 25, and the pair above that is 28 and 27. The pair above that is 30 and 29. The pair above that is 32 and 31. The pair above that is 34 and 33. The pair above that is 36 and 35.\n\nThe closest option is A: 29 and 28. However, 28 is on top of 27, and 29 is on top of 30.\n\nThe question is asking for the last two bricks placed, which are 2 and 1. None of the options are correct.\n\nHowever, if we assume the question is asking for the middle pair, then the middle pair is 26 and 25, and the pair above that is 28 and 27. The pair above that is 30 and 29. The pair above that is 32 and 31. The pair above that is 34 and 33. The pair above that is 36 and 35.\n\nThe closest option is A: 29 and 28.\n\nThe question is poorly worded. The correct answer should be 2 and 1.\n\nSince none of the options are correct, and the closest option is A, I will choose A.\n\n\\boxed{A}"

    "response": "The original rectangular parallelepiped is composed of 3 pieces, each consisting of 4 little cubes. In the first image, we can see two pieces: one is gray and the other is cross-hatched. The third piece is missing. We need to determine which of the options A, B, C, D, or E corresponds to the missing piece.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the original parallelepiped. It has dimensions 2x2x3, which means it has 12 cubes in total. The gray piece occupies 4 cubes, and the cross-hatched piece occupies 4 cubes. Therefore, the missing piece must also occupy 4 cubes.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n- Option A: This piece has 4 cubes and could fit in the missing space.\n- Option B: This piece has 4 cubes and could fit in the missing space.\n- Option C: This piece has 4 cubes and could fit in the missing space.\n- Option D: This piece has 4 cubes and could fit in the missing space.\n- Option E: This piece has 4 cubes and could fit in the missing space.\n\nWe need to determine which of these pieces would complete the original parallelepiped. By looking at the first image, we can see that the missing piece should have two cubes on the top layer and two cubes on the bottom layer. The two cubes on the top layer should be adjacent to the cross-hatched piece, and the two cubes on the bottom layer should be adjacent to the gray piece.\n\nComparing the options with the missing space, we can see that option B fits perfectly. The two cubes on the top layer of option B would be adjacent to the cross-hatched piece, and the two cubes on the bottom layer would be adjacent to the gray piece.\n\nTherefore, the missing piece is B.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{B}$"

    "response": "The problem states that Andrew has 27 small cubes, each with three adjacent faces painted red and the other three faces painted another color. He wants to build a larger cube using all 27 small cubes. Since 27 is 3 cubed (3x3x3), the larger cube will have dimensions of 3x3x3.\n\nThe small cubes can be oriented in two ways: either with the three red faces facing outwards or with the three red faces facing inwards. To maximize the number of completely red faces on the larger cube, we want to orient the small cubes so that as many of their red faces as possible are on the outside of the larger cube.\n\nThe larger cube has 6 faces. Each face of the larger cube is made up of 9 small cube faces (3x3).\n\nThe corner cubes of the larger cube have 3 faces exposed. If we orient the small cubes so that their 3 red faces are exposed, then each corner cube will contribute 3 red faces to the larger cube. There are 8 corner cubes, so they can contribute a total of 8 * 3 = 24 red faces.\n\nThe edge cubes of the larger cube have 2 faces exposed. If we orient the small cubes so that their 3 red faces are exposed, then each edge cube can contribute 2 red faces to the larger cube. There are 12 edge cubes, but we have already used the corner cubes, so we have 12 - 8 = 4 edge cubes per edge. There are 12 edges, so there are 12 * 1 = 12 edge cubes. Each edge cube can contribute 2 red faces, so they can contribute a total of 12 * 2 = 24 red faces.\n\nThe center cubes of the larger cube have 1 face exposed. If we orient the small cubes so that their 3 red faces are exposed, then each center cube can contribute 1 red face to the larger cube. There are 6 center cubes, so they can contribute a total of 6 * 1 = 6 red faces.\n\nThe center cube of the larger cube has 0 faces exposed. If we orient the small cubes so that their 3 red faces are exposed, then the center cube will not contribute any red faces to the larger cube. There is 1 center cube, so it contributes 0 red faces.\n\nHowever, we are only interested in the number of completely red faces on the larger cube. The corner cubes can be oriented so that each of the 3 red faces is on a different face of the larger cube. The edge cubes can be oriented so that each of the 2 red faces is on a different face of the larger cube. The center cubes can be oriented so that the 1 red face is on a face of the larger cube.\n\nThe larger cube has 6 faces. Each face is made up of 9 small cube faces. If we orient the small cubes so that all the red faces are on the outside, then we can have 3 faces of the larger cube completely red.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of completely red faces that he can get for this cube is 3.\n\n\\boxed{3}"

The volume of water in Tank I is now 100 cm\u00b2 * h.\n*   The water will rise until it reaches the top of Tank II, which is 7 cm.\n*   The volume of water in Tank I when the water level reaches 7 cm is 100 cm\u00b2 * 7 cm = 700 cm\u00b3.\n*   Since the initial volume of water is 1000 cm\u00b3, the water will overflow into Tank II.\n\n**4. Calculate the volume of water that overflows into Tank II:**\n\n*   The volume of water that overflows is the initial volume of water minus the volume of water in Tank I when the water level reaches 7 cm.\n*   Overflow volume = 1000 cm\u00b3 - 700 cm\u00b3 = 300 cm\u00b3\n\n**5.

This means each angle is 60 degrees.\n*   The marble (sphere) fits perfectly, meaning it's tangent to the sides of the cone.\n*   The depth of the hole is the vertical distance from the top of the cone to its tip.\n\n**2.

This line is a radius of the sphere and is perpendicular to the side of the cone.\n*   Draw a line from the center of the sphere to the tip of the cone. This line bisects the 60-degree angle of the cone, creating a 30-degree angle.\n*   We now have a 30-60-90 right triangle.

The removed cubes are located at the center of each face and the very center of the cube.\n\n2. **Space Diagonal:** A space diagonal connects opposite corners of the cube. There are four such diagonals.\n\n3. **Perpendicular Plane:** The plane cutting the figure is perpendicular to one of these space diagonals and passes through the center of the cube.\n\n4. **Cross-Section Shape:** When a plane cuts a cube perpendicular to a space diagonal and through the center, the cross-section is a regular hexagon.\n\n5. **Effect of Removed Cubes:** The removed cubes are located at the center of each face and the very center of the cube. The plane will intersect the removed cubes at the center of each face. The plane will also intersect the center cube.

    "solution": "Let the integers written on the small cubes in the bottom layer be arranged as shown.  \\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \\hline$a$ & $b$ & $c$ \\\\ \\hline$d$ & $e$ & $f$ \\\\ \\hline$g$ & $h$ & $i$ \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}  Hence, since the integers written on the cubes in the second and third layers are the sum of the integers on the four cubes underneath, the following is written on the cubes in the second layer.  $$ \\begin{array}{|l|l|} \\hline a+b+d+e & b+c+e+f \\\\ \\hline d+e+g+h & e+f+h+i \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} $$  Therefore the integer written on the top cube is  $$ \\begin{aligned} & (a+b+d+e)+(b+c+e+f)+(d+e+g+h)+(e+f+h+i) \\\\ & \\quad=(a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i)+(b+d+f+h)+3 e \\end{aligned} $$  Since the sum of the integers on the bottom layer is 50 , the integer written on the top cube is equal to $50+(b+d+f+h)+3 e$. To maximise this, we first require $e$ to be as large as possible which will be obtained when the other eight integers are as small as possible. Therefore $e=50-(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8)=14$.  Secondly, $(b+d+f+h)$ should now be made as large as possible and hence $b, d, f$ and $h$ are 5, 6, 7 and 8 in any order. Therefore $(b+d+f+h)=5+6+7+8=26$. Hence the greatest possible integer she can write on the top cube is $50+26+3 \\times 14=118$.",

    "solution": "Note first that a small cube in the centre of a face of the large cube will only appear on one face while a cube appearing on the edge of a face of the large cube will appear on two faces and a cube appearing at a corner of the face of the large cube will appear on three faces. Hence, the total number of white faces on the edge of the large cube is an even number and the total number of white faces on the corners of the large cube is a multiple of 3 . The five faces shown contain 1 centre white face from 1 small white cube, 12 edge white faces and 5 corner white faces. Therefore, since the total number of white faces on the corners is a multiple of 3 , the missing face contains 1 or 4 white faces at its corners. None of the options contains 4 white corners so the missing face contains one white corner as in options A and E, making 6 in total. These 6 faces come from $6 \\div 3=2$ small white cubes. Both options $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ have two white faces on their edges, making 14 in total over the six faces from $14 \\div 2=7$ white cubes. Hence the number of white cubes whose positions we know is $1+7+2=10$. The large cube is made with 12 small white cubes so there are still two more to be placed. One can be at the centre of the large cube and the only place the remaining cube can be is at the centre of the missing face. Therefore, the missing face contains one centre white face, two edge white faces and one corner white face. Hence, the missing face is A. (This proof shows that the only possible missing face for such a cube is face A. It is left to the reader to check that the five given faces and face A can indeed be fitted together consistently to form the faces of a cube.)",

    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the problem.\n\n1. **Understanding the Dice:** A standard die has faces with 1 to 6 pips. Opposite faces always add up to 7 (1-6, 2-5, 3-4).\n\n2. **Visible Faces:** In the image, we see four dice arranged in a row. Each die has 5 faces visible (top, bottom, front, left, and right). The faces where the dice are glued together are not visible.\n\n3. **Minimizing Pips:** To minimize the total number of pips, we want to maximize the number of 6s that are hidden. Since opposite faces add to 7, if we hide a 6, we are showing a 1. If we hide a 5, we are showing a 2, and so on.\n\n4. **Hidden Faces:** Each die has one face hidden where it is glued to another die. The two end dice each have one hidden face, and the two middle dice each have two hidden faces. So, there are a total of 6 hidden faces.\n\n5. **Minimizing Visible Pips:** To minimize the visible pips, we want to hide as many 6s as possible. We can hide 6s on all 6 hidden faces. This means that the opposite faces (the ones that are visible) will be 1s.\n\n6. **Calculating Visible Pips:** Each die has 5 visible faces. If we hide a 6, the opposite face is a 1. So, each die will have 4 faces that are not 1s. To minimize the visible pips, we want to make these faces 1, 2, 3, and 4. The sum of these faces is 1+2+3+4 = 10. Since there are 4 dice, the total sum of the visible faces is 4 * 10 = 40. However, we also have the 4 faces that are opposite the hidden 6s, which are 1s. So, we have 4 * 1 = 4. The total sum of the visible faces is 40 + 4 = 44.\n\n7. **Total Minimum Pips:** Each die has 5 visible faces. If we hide a 6, the opposite face is a 1. So, each die will have 4 faces that are not 1s. To minimize the visible pips, we want to make these faces 1, 2, 3, and 4. The sum of these faces is 1+2+3+4 = 10. Since there are 4 dice, the total sum of the visible faces is 4 * 10 = 40. However, we also have the 4 faces that are opposite the hidden 6s, which are 1s. So, we have 4 * 1 = 4. The total sum of the visible faces is 40 + 4 = 44.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of pips that could lie on the whole surface is 44.\n\n\\boxed{44}"

When we fold the vertices to the center, we are essentially creating three equilateral triangles. The angles at the center will be 60 degrees each. The resulting figure will have six points, and the angles at these points will be 60 degrees. The resulting figure will be a six-pointed star.\n\nTherefore, the shape of the figure that is formed is a six-pointed star.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$"

    "response": "The problem describes a triangle $ABC$ with side lengths $BC=23$, $CA=27$, and $AB=30$. Points $V, W$ are on $AC$, $X, Y$ are on $BC$, and $Z, U$ are on $AB$. The segments $UV$, $WX$, and $YZ$ are parallel to $BC$, $AB$, and $CA$, respectively. Right angle folds are made along these segments, creating a table with triangular legs. The goal is to find the maximum possible height $h$ of the table and express it in the form $\\frac{k\\sqrt{m}}{n}$, where $k$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers and $m$ is a positive integer not divisible by the square of any prime. Then we need to find $k+m+n$.\n\nLet $x$ be the length of the segments $UV$, $WX$, and $YZ$. Since the segments are parallel to the sides of the triangle, the triangles formed by the folds are similar to the original triangle. Let $h_a$, $h_b$, and $h_c$ be the altitudes from vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively. The height of the table is given by $h = \\frac{x}{a} h_a = \\frac{x}{b} h_b = \\frac{x}{c} h_c$, where $a=23$, $b=27$, and $c=30$. The maximum height occurs when the sum of the lengths of the legs is maximized. The sum of the lengths of the legs is $h_a + h_b + h_c$. The height of the table is maximized when $x$ is maximized. The maximum value of $x$ occurs when the three segments meet at a point, which is the incenter of the triangle. In this case, the height of the table is the inradius $r$ of the triangle.\n\nWe can use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle. The semi-perimeter $s = \\frac{23+27+30}{2} = \\frac{80}{2} = 40$. The area $A$ is given by\n$$A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{40(40-23)(40-27)(40-30)} = \\sqrt{40(17)(13)(10)} = \\sqrt{88400} = 20\\sqrt{221}$$\nThe inradius $r$ is given by $r = \\frac{A}{s} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{221}}{40} = \\frac{\\sqrt{221}}{2}$.\nThus, the maximum height of the table is $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{221}}{2}$.\nWe have $k=1$, $m=221$, and $n=2$.\nThen $k+m+n = 1+221+2 = 224$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{224}$"

We want to find the least possible distance between a point $P$ on edge $AB$ and a point $Q$ on edge $CD$.\n\nWe can visualize the tetrahedron in 3D space. Let's consider the midpoint of $AB$, call it $M$, and the midpoint of $CD$, call it $N$. The line segment $MN$ is perpendicular to both $AB$ and $CD$. The length of $MN$ is the shortest distance between the edges $AB$ and $CD$.\n\nTo find the length of $MN$, we can consider the triangle $AMC$. Since $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, $AM = \\frac{1}{2}$. Also, $AC = 1$. We can find the length of $CM$ using the law of cosines in triangle $ABC$. Since $ABC$ is an equilateral triangle with side length 1, the angle $\\angle BAC = 60^\\circ$.\nIn triangle $AMC$, we have $AM = \\frac{1}{2}$, $AC = 1$, and $\\angle MAC = 60^\\circ$.\nUsing the law of cosines, we have\n$CM^2 = AM^2 + AC^2 - 2(AM)(AC)\\cos(60^\\circ)$\n$CM^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 + 1^2 - 2(\\frac{1}{2})(1)(\\frac{1}{2})$\n$CM^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{4}{4} - \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n$CM = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\nNow, consider the triangle $MCN$.

It is an equilateral triangle with side length 1. The median from $C$ to $AD$ has length $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The median from $D$ to $AC$ also has length $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The intersection of these medians is the centroid of the triangle, which is also the midpoint of the line segment connecting the midpoints of $AC$ and $AD$.\nLet $N$ be the midpoint of $CD$.

    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the figure.\n\n1. **Corner Cubes:** The four corner cubes on the base layer each have three faces exposed on the outside of the figure. When the figure is painted, these three faces will be red. The bottom face will also be red, so these cubes will have four red faces.\n\n2. **Edge Cubes:** The four edge cubes on the base layer (not corners) each have two faces exposed on the outside of the figure. When the figure is painted, these two faces will be red. The bottom face will also be red, and one more face will be red, so these cubes will have four red faces.\n\n3. **Center Cube:** The center cube on the base layer has one face exposed on the outside of the figure. When the figure is painted, this face will be red. The bottom face will also be red, and the other four faces will not be red, so this cube will have two red faces.\n\n4. **Top Cubes:** The four top cubes each have three faces exposed on the outside of the figure. When the figure is painted, these three faces will be red. The bottom face will not be red, so these cubes will have three red faces.\n\nTherefore, the cubes with exactly four red faces are the four corner cubes and the four edge cubes on the base layer. That's a total of 8 cubes.\n\n\\boxed{8}"

When the cube is cut into four pieces, the total surface area of the four pieces is still 6 square feet plus the area of the cuts. The first cut adds two 1x1 faces, the second cut adds two 1x1 faces, and the third cut adds two 1x1 faces. So the total surface area of the four pieces is 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12 square feet.

    "solution": "On a normal cube, the ant would like to walk on a straight line on the net of the cube. In this special cube with holes in the middle, the ant would ideally want to travel as spacially close to the space diagonal as possible while still traveling in a straight line on the net. To do this, it can travel in two separate straight line segments from $A$ to $P$ to $B$, where $P$ is the midpoint of the edge it lies on. By symmetry, notice how the path from $A$ to $P$ is the same length as the path from $P$ to $B$. So, our answer is just twice the length of the path from $A$ to $P$.

The key here is that from any vertex, there are 5 edges leading to 5 adjacent vertices.\n\n**Defining States**\n\nLet's define states based on the \"distance\" from point Z. We can think of this as the number of edges we need to traverse to reach Z.\n\n*   **State A:** Annie is at point A (distance 5 from Z).\n*   **State 1:** Annie is at a vertex adjacent to A (distance 4 from Z). There are 5 such vertices.\n*   **State 2:** Annie is at a vertex adjacent to a State 1 vertex (distance 3 from Z). There are 5 such vertices.\n*   **State 3:** Annie is at a vertex adjacent to a State 2 vertex (distance 2 from Z). There are 5 such vertices.\n*   **State 4:** Annie is at a vertex adjacent to a State 3 vertex (distance 1 from Z). There are 5 such vertices.\n*   **State Z:** Annie is at point Z (distance 0 from Z).\n\n**Expected Moves**\n\nLet E(A) be the expected number of moves to reach Z from A, E(1) be the expected number of moves to reach Z from a State 1 vertex, and so on.\n\n*   **E(Z) = 0** (If Annie is at Z, she's done).\n\n*   **E(4):** From a State 4 vertex, Annie has 1/5 chance of going to Z and 4/5 chance of going to a State 3 vertex. So, E(4) = (1/5) * 1 + (4/5) * (1 + E(3)) = 1 + (4/5)E(3)\n\n*   **E(3):** From a State 3 vertex, Annie has 2/5 chance of going to a State 4 vertex and 3/5 chance of going to a State 2 vertex. So, E(3) = (2/5) * (1 + E(4)) + (3/5) * (1 + E(2)) = 1 + (2/5)E(4) + (3/5)E(2)\n\n*   **E(2):** From a State 2 vertex, Annie has 3/5 chance of going to a State 3 vertex and 2/5 chance of going to a State 1 vertex.

The gray paint covers the following unit squares:\n- The four corners (1x1 squares)\n- The center 3x3 square, excluding the center 1x1 square.\n\nThis means that on each face, there are 4 corner squares and 8 squares in the center, for a total of 12 painted squares. The unpainted squares on each face are the 13 squares that are not painted.\n\nThe cube is 5x5x5, so it has a total of 5*5*5 = 125 unit cubes.\n\nThe unpainted cubes are those that are not on the surface. The unpainted cubes form a smaller cube inside the larger cube. Since the outer layer of cubes is painted, the unpainted cubes form a 3x3x3 cube. The number of unpainted cubes is 3*3*3 = 27.\n\nThe fraction of unpainted cubes is the number of unpainted cubes divided by the total number of cubes.\nFraction = 27/125\n\n\\boxed{27/125}"

    "response": "Let's analyze the problem. We have a 5x5 grid initially all white, and we want to transform it into a chessboard pattern. Each move involves flipping the color of three adjacent cells in a row or column.\n\nFirst, let's consider the rows. In the target chessboard pattern, the first row has alternating colors, starting with white. To achieve this, we can flip the first three cells in the first row. This will give us black-white-black. Then, we can flip the last three cells in the first row, which will give us black-white-black-white-black. This requires two moves.\n\nSimilarly, we can apply the same logic to the other rows. For the second row, we need to start with black, so we can flip the first three cells, then the last three cells. This will give us white-black-white-black-white. This also requires two moves.\n\nWe can apply this to all five rows. Each row requires two moves. So, for all five rows, we need 5 * 2 = 10 moves.\n\nNow, let's consider the columns. If we apply the row operations, we will have the correct chessboard pattern. Therefore, we don't need to do any column operations.\n\nSo, the minimum number of moves required is 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{B}$"

The squares are colored alternately.\n\nLet's label the squares as follows:\n```\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\n```\nWhere A, C, G, and I are shaded, and B, D, F, and H are unshaded, and E is shaded.\n\nNotice that each unshaded square is adjacent to only shaded squares, and each shaded square is adjacent to only unshaded squares.\n\nIf we start at an unshaded square, the next square must be shaded, the next unshaded, and so on. Since there are 5 shaded squares and 4 unshaded squares, the path must end at a shaded square.\n\nIf we start at a shaded square, the next square must be unshaded, the next shaded, and so on. Since there are 5 shaded squares and 4 unshaded squares, the path must end at a shaded square.\n\nLet's consider the degree of each square. The degree of a square is the number of adjacent squares.\n- Corner squares (A, C, G, I) have degree 2.\n- Edge squares (B, D, F, H) have degree 3.\n- Center square (E) has degree 4.\n\nA path that visits every square exactly once is called a Hamiltonian path.\nIn a Hamiltonian path, the start and end squares must have an odd degree.\nThe corner squares have degree 2, which is even.\nThe edge squares have degree 3, which is odd.\nThe center square has degree 4, which is even.\n\nSince the path must start and end at a square with an odd degree, the start and end squares must be edge squares.\nHowever, we need to visit every square exactly once.\nLet's try starting at an edge square, say B.\nB -> A -> D -> G -> H -> I -> F -> C -> E\nThis path visits every square exactly once.\nLet's try starting at a corner square, say A.\nA -> B -> C -> F -> I -> H -> G -> D -> E\nThis path visits every square exactly once.\nLet's try starting at the center square, E.\nE -> B -> A -> D -> G -> H -> I -> F -> C\nThis path visits every square exactly once.\n\nHowever, we can also think of this as a graph problem. The squares are the vertices, and the edges are the possible moves.\nThe graph is bipartite, with 5 shaded squares and 4 unshaded squares.\nA Hamiltonian path must alternate between shaded and unshaded squares.\nSince there are 5 shaded squares and 4 unshaded squares, the path must start and end at a shaded square.\nThe only shaded squares are the corners and the center.\nThe corners have degree 2, and the center has degree 4.\nThe edge squares have degree 3.\nThe path must start and end at a square with an odd degree.\nThe only squares with odd degree are the edge squares.\nHowever, we can start at any square.\n\nLet's try starting at a corner square, A.\nA -> B -> C -> F -> I -> H -> G -> D -> E\nThis works.\nLet's try starting at an edge square, B.\nB -> A -> D -> G -> H -> I -> F -> C -> E\nThis works.\nLet's try starting at the center square, E.\nE -> B -> A -> D -> G -> H -> I -> F -> C\nThis works.\n\nSince we can start at any square, the answer is E.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{E}$"

The dark mouse travels 10/8 = 1.25 times the distance of the white mouse.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the white mouse's speed.**\n\nSince they arrive at the same time, the ratio of their speeds is the inverse of the ratio of their distances.

    "response": "Let's analyze the problem. We are given that trains travel from X to Y in 180 minutes and from Y to X in 60 minutes. The key is that trains can meet only in the double-track section. This means that if two trains start simultaneously from X and Y, they must meet in the double-track section.\n\nLet's denote the distance from X to the start of the double track as $d_1$, the length of the double track as $d_2$, and the distance from the end of the double track to Y as $d_3$. The total distance is $d = d_1 + d_2 + d_3$.\n\nLet $v_1$ be the speed of the train from X to Y and $v_2$ be the speed of the train from Y to X. We have:\n$d = 180v_1$\n$d = 60v_2$\nTherefore, $180v_1 = 60v_2$, which means $v_2 = 3v_1$.\n\nLet $t$ be the time when the two trains meet. The train from X travels a distance $v_1t$ and the train from Y travels a distance $v_2t$. The sum of these distances must be equal to the distance to the meeting point. Since they meet in the double track, the distance traveled by the train from X is $d_1 + x$ and the distance traveled by the train from Y is $d_3 + (d_2 - x)$, where $x$ is the distance from the start of the double track to the meeting point.\n\nThe train from X travels $d_1$ in time $t_1 = d_1/v_1$. The train from Y travels $d_3$ in time $t_3 = d_3/v_2 = d_3/(3v_1)$.\nThe train from X travels $d_1 + x$ in time $t$. The train from Y travels $d_3 + (d_2 - x)$ in time $t$.\nSince the trains start at the same time, the time to meet is the same for both trains.\n$t = \\frac{d_1 + x}{v_1} = \\frac{d_3 + d_2 - x}{v_2} = \\frac{d_3 + d_2 - x}{3v_1}$\n$3(d_1 + x) = d_3 + d_2 - x$\n$3d_1 + 3x = d_3 + d_2 - x$\n$4x = d_3 + d_2 - 3d_1$\n\nThe key is that the trains meet in the double track. This means that the train from X must reach the double track before the train from Y reaches the double track.\nThe time for the train from X to reach the double track is $t_1 = d_1/v_1$.\nThe time for the train from Y to reach the double track is $t_3 + t_2 = d_3/v_2 + d_2/v_2 = d_3/(3v_1) + d_2/(3v_1)$.\nSince the trains meet in the double track, the train from X must reach the double track before the train from Y reaches the double track.\n$d_1/v_1 < d_3/(3v_1) + d_2/(3v_1)$\n$3d_1 < d_3 + d_2$\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n(A) The double track is at the beginning. The train from X will reach the double track immediately. The train from Y will take some time to reach the double track. This is possible.\n(B) The double track is in the middle. This is possible.\n(C) The double track is in the middle. This is possible.\n(D) The double track is in the middle. This is possible.\n(E) The double track is at the end. The train from Y will reach the double track immediately. The train from X will take some time to reach the double track. This is not possible.\n\nSince the train from Y travels 3 times faster than the train from X, the train from Y will cover 3 times the distance in the same time. If the double track is at the end, the train from Y will reach the double track before the train from X. This is not possible.\n\nThe only option where the double track is not at the end is (A), (B), (C), and (D).\nSince the trains can meet, the double track must be long enough for the trains to meet.\nThe train from Y travels 3 times faster than the train from X.\nThe train from X travels $d_1$ before reaching the double track.\nThe train from Y travels $d_3$ before reaching the double track.\nThe train from Y travels 3 times faster, so $d_3$ must be less than $3d_1$.\nThe only option that satisfies this is (D).\n\nThe correct answer is (D).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{D}$"

    "response": "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understand the Movement Pattern**\n\nThe particle moves in a square spiral pattern. It moves one unit at a time, alternating between horizontal and vertical movements. The pattern is:\n* Right\n* Up\n* Left\n* Down\n* Right\n* Up\n* Left\n* Down\n* ... and so on.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Time**\n\nTwo hours is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.\n\n**3. Track the Movement**\n\nLet's track the particle's position after each \"square\" of the spiral:\n\n*   **Square 1:**\n    *   1 minute: (1, 0)\n    *   2 minutes: (1, 1)\n    *   3 minutes: (0, 1)\n    *   4 minutes: (0, 0)\n    *   Total: 4 minutes, 4 steps\n*   **Square 2:**\n    *   5 minutes: (2, 0)\n    *   6 minutes: (2, 2)\n    *   7 minutes: (0, 2)\n    *   8 minutes: (0, 0)\n    *   Total: 8 minutes, 8 steps\n*   **Square 3:**\n    *   9 minutes: (3, 0)\n    *   10 minutes: (3, 3)\n    *   11 minutes: (0, 3)\n    *   12 minutes: (0, 0)\n    *   Total: 12 minutes, 12 steps\n\nNotice a pattern: the number of steps in each square is 4 times the square number. The total number of steps after completing n squares is 4 * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) = 4 * n * (n+1) / 2 = 2 * n * (n+1).\n\n**4. Find the Square**\n\nWe need to find the largest 'n' such that 2 * n * (n+1) <= 120.\n* If n = 7, 2 * 7 * 8 = 112\n* If n = 8, 2 * 8 * 9 = 144\n\nSo, after 7 squares, the particle has moved for 112 minutes. It has 120 - 112 = 8 minutes left.\n\n**5. Determine the Position**\n\nAfter 7 squares, the particle is at (0,0). The next square is square 8.\n*   113 minutes: (8, 0)\n*   114 minutes: (8, 8)\n*   115 minutes: (0, 8)\n*   116 minutes: (0, 0)\n*   117 minutes: (9, 0)\n*   118 minutes: (9, 9)\n*   119 minutes: (0, 9)\n*   120 minutes: (0, 0)\n\nThe particle has moved 8 steps into the 8th square.\n*   113 minutes: (8, 0)\n*   114 minutes: (8, 1)\n*   115 minutes: (8, 2)\n*   116 minutes: (8, 3)\n*   117 minutes: (8, 4)\n*   118 minutes: (8, 5)\n*   119 minutes: (8, 6)\n*   120 minutes: (8, 7)\n\nThe particle will be at (8, 7) after 120 minutes.\n\n**6. Correct the Calculation**\n\nThe pattern is that after completing n squares, the particle is at (0,0). The number of steps in each square is 4 times the square number. The total number of steps after completing n squares is 4 * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) = 4 * n * (n+1) / 2 = 2 * n * (n+1).\n\nWe need to find the largest 'n' such that 2 * n * (n+1) <= 120.\n* If n = 7, 2 * 7 * 8 = 112\n* If n = 8, 2 * 8 * 9 = 144\n\nSo, after 7 squares, the particle has moved for 112 minutes. It has 120 - 112 = 8 minutes left.\n\nAfter 7 squares, the particle is at (0,0). The next square is square 8.\n*   113 minutes: (8, 0)\n*   114 minutes: (8, 8)\n*   115 minutes: (0, 8)\n*   116 minutes: (0, 0)\n*   117 minutes: (9, 0)\n*   118 minutes: (9, 9)\n*   119 minutes: (0, 9)\n*   120 minutes: (0, 0)\n\nThe particle has moved 8 steps into the 8th square.\n*   113 minutes: (8, 0)\n*   114 minutes: (8, 1)\n*   115 minutes: (8, 2)\n*   116 minutes: (8, 3)\n*   117 minutes: (8, 4)\n*   118 minutes: (8, 5)\n*   119 minutes: (8, 6)\n*   120 minutes: (8, 7)\n\nThe particle will be at (8, 7) after 120 minutes.\n\n**7. Final Answer**\n\nThe correct answer is not among the options. The particle will be at (8,7).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the pattern. After 7 squares, the particle has moved 112 steps and is at (0,0). The 8 remaining steps are:\n1. (8,0)\n2. (8,1)\n3. (8,2)\n4. (8,3)\n5. (8,4)\n6. (8,5)\n7. (8,6)\n8.

    "solution": "The computer will draw its path over 2 minutes or 120 seconds. The number of unit lengths successively between the points $(1,0),(0,2),(3,0),(0,4),(5,0)$, and so on, increases by 2 each time. Starting at 1 and adding consecutive odd numbers leads to the sequence of square numbers, and so the path will reach $(n, 0)$, where $n$ is an odd number, after $n^{2}$ seconds. So after 121 seconds it would reach $(11,0)$ and after 2 minutes $(10,0)$. Alternatively, when the computer path reaches a grid point, shade grey the unit square immediately below and to the left of that point. For example, the diagram shows the area shaded grey when the path has reached $(2,0)$. Since each unit added to the path also adds one unit to the grey shaded area, the path length and the grey shaded area have the same numerical value. For convenience, shade black the unit square below and to the left of $(0,0)$. After 2 minutes, or 120 seconds, the path length is 120 , so the grey shaded area is 120 , and the total shaded area is 121 . But $121=11^{2}$, so that the total shaded area is a square of side 11 and the path has reached $(10,0)$. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_27_0f4ed2787981bb911326g-038.jpg?height=385&width=412&top_left_y=2149&top_left_x=1413)",

We can label the squares in the grid using coordinates (row, column), where P is at (1,1) and Q is at (5,5). The obstacles are located at:\n1. (2,2) to (2,3)\n2. (3,2) to (4,2)\n3. (2,5) to (3,5)\n\nLet's analyze the paths that are blocked by the obstacles.\n1. Obstacle 1: (2,2) to (2,3). Any path that goes through (2,2) and (2,3) is blocked. To reach (2,2) from (1,1), we need 1 R and 1 D, so there are $\\binom{2}{1} = 2$ ways. To reach (5,5) from (2,3), we need 3 R and 3 D, so there are $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways. So, there are $2 \\times 20 = 40$ paths that go through (2,2) and (2,3).\n2. Obstacle 2: (3,2) to (4,2). Any path that goes through (3,2) and (4,2) is blocked. To reach (3,2) from (1,1), we need 1 R and 2 D, so there are $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways. To reach (5,5) from (4,2), we need 3 R and 2 D, so there are $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways. So, there are $3 \\times 10 = 30$ paths that go through (3,2) and (4,2).\n3. Obstacle 3: (2,5) to (3,5). Any path that goes through (2,5) and (3,5) is blocked. To reach (2,5) from (1,1), we need 4 R and 1 D, so there are $\\binom{5}{1} = 5$ ways. To reach (5,5) from (3,5), we need 2 R and 2 D, so there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways. So, there are $5 \\times 6 = 30$ paths that go through (2,5) and (3,5).\n\nHowever, we have overcounted some paths. Let's consider paths that go through both obstacle 1 and obstacle 2. To reach (2,2) from (1,1), we have 2 ways. To reach (3,2) from (2,2), we have 1 way (D). To reach (4,2) from (3,2), we have 1 way (D). To reach (5,5) from (4,2), we have 10 ways. So, there are $2 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 10 = 20$ paths that go through both obstacle 1 and obstacle 2.\nLet's consider paths that go through both obstacle 1 and obstacle 3. To reach (2,2) from (1,1), we have 2 ways. To reach (2,3) from (2,2), we have 1 way (R). To reach (2,5) from (2,3), we have 2 ways (RR). To reach (3,5) from (2,5), we have 1 way (D). To reach (5,5) from (3,5), we have 6 ways. So, there are $2 \\times 1 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 6 = 24$ paths that go through both obstacle 1 and obstacle 3.\nLet's consider paths that go through both obstacle 2 and obstacle 3. To reach (3,2) from (1,1), we have 3 ways. To reach (4,2) from (3,2), we have 1 way (D). To reach (2,5) from (4,2), we have 0 ways. So, there are 0 paths that go through both obstacle 2 and obstacle 3.\nThere are no paths that go through all three obstacles.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of blocked paths is $40 + 30 + 30 - 20 - 24 - 0 = 56$.\nThe number of shortest paths is $70 - 56 = 14$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{14}$"

    "response": "Let $R$ be the radius of the clock face, so $R = 20$ cm. Let $r$ be the radius of the disk, so $r = 10$ cm.\nThe circumference of the clock face is $C_R = 2\\pi R = 2\\pi(20) = 40\\pi$ cm.\nThe circumference of the disk is $C_r = 2\\pi r = 2\\pi(10) = 20\\pi$ cm.\n\nWhen the disk rolls around the clock face, the distance the center of the disk travels is along a circle of radius $R+r = 20+10 = 30$ cm.\nThe circumference of this circle is $2\\pi(R+r) = 2\\pi(30) = 60\\pi$ cm.\n\nThe disk rotates as it rolls around the clock face. The distance the disk travels along the clock face is equal to the arc length of the circle with radius $R+r$ that the center of the disk travels.\nLet $\\theta$ be the angle (in radians) that the center of the disk travels around the clock face. The arc length traveled by the center of the disk is $(R+r)\\theta = 30\\theta$.\nThe distance the disk rolls is equal to the arc length of the disk that has touched the clock face. Let $\\phi$ be the angle (in radians) that the disk rotates. The arc length of the disk that has touched the clock face is $r\\phi = 10\\phi$.\nSince the disk rolls without slipping, the arc length traveled by the center of the disk is equal to the arc length of the disk that has touched the clock face. Thus, $30\\theta = 10\\phi$, which implies $\\phi = 3\\theta$.\n\nThe arrow on the disk will point upward again when the disk has rotated by a multiple of $2\\pi$. Let $n$ be an integer. Then $\\phi = 2\\pi n$.\nSince $\\phi = 3\\theta$, we have $3\\theta = 2\\pi n$, so $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi n}{3}$.\nWe want the first time the arrow points upward again, so we take $n=1$. Then $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\nThe arc length traveled by the center of the disk is $(R+r)\\theta = 30\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) = 20\\pi$.\nThe arc length traveled by the point of tangency on the clock face is $R\\theta = 20\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{40\\pi}{3}$.\nThe circumference of the clock face is $40\\pi$.\nThe fraction of the clock face that the disk has traveled is $\\frac{\\frac{40\\pi}{3}}{40\\pi} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nSince the clock face is a circle, $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the circle corresponds to $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 360^\\circ = 120^\\circ$.\nStarting at 12 o'clock, moving $120^\\circ$ clockwise will bring us to 4 o'clock.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{C}$"

We need to find the probability that the student passes through C.\n\nFirst, let's count the total number of paths from A to B. To reach B from A, the student must move 4 steps east and 3 steps south, in any order. The total number of steps is 7. The number of paths is the number of ways to choose 3 south steps (or 4 east steps) out of 7 steps, which is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$ \\binom{7}{3} = \\binom{7}{4} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35 $$\nSince each choice at an intersection has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$, each path has a probability of $(\\frac{1}{2})^7$.\n\nNow, let's count the number of paths from A to B that pass through C. To reach C from A, the student must move 3 steps east and 2 steps south. The number of paths from A to C is:\n$$ \\binom{5}{2} = \\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10 $$\nTo reach B from C, the student must move 1 step east and 1 step south. The number of paths from C to B is:\n$$ \\binom{2}{1} = \\binom{2}{1} = \\frac{2!}{1!1!} = 2 $$\nThe number of paths from A to B that pass through C is the product of the number of paths from A to C and the number of paths from C to B:\n$$ 10 \\times 2 = 20 $$\nThe probability of passing through C is the number of paths through C divided by the total number of paths from A to B:\n$$ \\frac{20}{35} = \\frac{4}{7} $$\n\nThe probability that the student goes through C is $\\frac{20}{35} = \\frac{4}{7}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{C}$"
