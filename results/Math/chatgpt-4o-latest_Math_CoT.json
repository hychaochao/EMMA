It has:\n- A vertical column of 4 squares.\n- A horizontal row of 3 squares at the top right.\n- A horizontal row of 3 squares at the bottom right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Compare the given options (A, B, C, D, and E)**\nFor each option, we need to check if its shape is entirely contained within the figure in image1.

A smaller square (1/4 of the original square).\n2. A right isosceles triangle (1/4 of the original square).\n3. A larger right isosceles triangle (1/2 of the original square).\n4.

Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the setup\nEach original metal strip has equally spaced holes, and they are bolted together to form pairs. The resulting long strips (A, B, C, D, E) have varying angles between the bolted pairs. The length of these long strips depends on the angles between the two original strips.\n\n- If the two strips are aligned in a straight line, the total length is maximized.\n- If the two strips are at an angle (e.g., forming a \"V\" shape), the total length is shorter.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the strips\nWe now analyze the configurations of A, B, C, D, and E:\n\n- **Strip A**: The two strips are bolted at an acute angle, forming a \"V\" shape. This makes the total length shorter than if they were aligned straight.\n  \n- **Strip B**: The two strips are bolted at nearly a right angle, forming an \"L\" shape. This configuration further reduces the total length compared to A.\n  \n- **Strip C**: The two strips are bolted at an obtuse angle, making the total length longer than A and B but shorter than a fully straight alignment.\n  \n- **Strip D**: The two strips are bolted at a very small angle (almost straight). This configuration results in a length very close to the maximum possible length.\n  \n- **Strip E**: The two strips are perfectly aligned in a straight line, resulting in the maximum possible length.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine the shortest strip\nThe shortest strip is the one with the smallest total length. Based on the analysis:\n\n- **Strip A** is shorter than C, D, and E, but longer than B.\n- **Strip B** has the most acute angle (close to a right angle), making it the shortest among all.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe shortest strip is **B**. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",

The pattern starts at the left and continues to the right, following a specific structure. It is important to note that the pattern ends before the labeled points (A, B, C, D, E) appear on the grid. \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Locate the labeled points\nThe labeled points (A, B, C, D, E) are positioned as follows:\n\n- Point \\( A \\): (x = 6, y = 4)\n- Point \\( B \\): (x = 7, y = 5)\n- Point \\( C \\): (x = 7, y = 3)\n- Point \\( D \\): (x = 9, y = 4)\n- Point \\( E \\): (x = 10, y = 5)\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Repeat the pattern\nPeter draws the **same pattern once more**. This means that the original pattern is repeated starting immediately to the right of where the first pattern ends.

    "response": "To solve this problem step by step, let's analyze the folding process carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the folding process and angle relationships\n- A strip of paper is folded three times, resulting in the final configuration shown in the diagram.\n- At each fold, the paper bends, and the angles involved affect the final configuration.\n- The given angle \\(\\alpha = 70^\\circ\\) is used to find the final angle \\(\\beta\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the first fold\n- In the first fold, the strip is folded such that the angle of the fold is \\(180^\\circ - 2\\alpha\\). This results because the fold creates two adjacent angles summing to \\(180^\\circ\\), and each is equal to \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the second fold\n- In the second fold, the paper is folded again in a similar manner. The fold angle here is also related to \\(180^\\circ - 2\\alpha\\), as the paper is folded symmetrically.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the third fold\n- Finally, in the third fold, the paper is folded again similarly. The key is to realize that \\(\\beta\\) is the external angle formed by the overlap of the folds.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Relationship between \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\alpha\\)\n- The final angle \\(\\beta\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\beta = 3(180^\\circ - 2\\alpha)\n\\]\nThis is derived because each fold contributes \\(180^\\circ - 2\\alpha\\), and there are three folds. Simplify this expression:\n\\[\n\\beta = 540^\\circ - 6\\alpha\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Substitute \\(\\alpha = 70^\\circ\\)\n- Substitute \\(\\alpha = 70^\\circ\\) into the formula for \\(\\beta\\):\n\\[\n\\beta = 540^\\circ - 6(70^\\circ)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta = 540^\\circ - 420^\\circ\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta = 120^\\circ\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Match the result with the options\nThe final value of \\(\\beta\\) is \\(120^\\circ\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",

The unit square has a side length of \\( 1 \\).\n2. The equilateral triangle has side length \\( 1 \\) (since it fits along one side of the square).\n3. The equilateral triangle rolls around the square, and the point on the triangle traces a path.\n\nWhen the triangle rolls around the square, the point traces a combination of **arcs** and **straight segments**. We need to calculate the total length of this path until the triangle and the point return to their starting positions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine when the triangle and point return to the starting positions\n\nThe triangle and the point return to their starting positions when:\n1. The triangle has completed one full circuit around the square, meaning it has rolled a total distance equal to the perimeter of the square.\n2. The point on the triangle also completes its motion (rotations and translations) and returns to its starting position.\n\n#### Perimeter of the square:\nThe unit square has a side length of \\( 1 \\), so its perimeter is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 1 = 4\n\\]\n\n#### Rotational symmetry of the triangle:\nAs the triangle rolls, it rotates about its vertices. The triangle has \\( 3 \\) sides, so it returns to its starting orientation after \\( 3 \\) rotations.\n\nThus, the triangle and point return to their starting positions after completing \\( 3 \\) full circuits around the square.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Decompose the path of the point\n\nFor each circuit around the square, the motion of the point consists of:\n1. **Arcs**: As the triangle rotates around its corners, the point traces circular arcs.\n2. **Straight-line segments**: When the triangle rolls along the straight edges of the square, the point moves in a straight line.\n\n#### Contribution from arcs:\nFor each corner of the square:\n- The triangle rotates by \\( 120^\\circ = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\) radians.\n- The point traces a circular arc of radius equal to the side length of the triangle, \\( 1 \\).\n- The length of this arc is:\n\\[\n\\text{Arc length per corner} = \\text{radius} \\times \\text{angle in radians} = 1 \\times \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\n\\]\nThere are \\( 4 \\) corners, so the total arc length per circuit is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total arc length per circuit} = 4 \\times \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{8\\pi}{3}\n\\]\n\n#### Contribution from straight-line segments:\nFor each side of the square:\n- The triangle rolls along a side of length \\( 1 \\), and the point traces a straight segment of length \\( 1 \\).\n- There are \\( 4 \\) sides, so the total straight-line segment length per circuit is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total straight-line length per circuit} = 4 \\times 1 = 4\n\\]\n\n#### Total path length per circuit:\nThe total path length traced by the point for one circuit is the sum of the arc lengths and straight-line segment lengths:\n\\[\n\\text{Total path length per circuit} = \\frac{8\\pi}{3} + 4\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total path length for \\( 3 \\) circuits\n\nSince the triangle and the point return to their starting positions after \\( 3 \\) circuits, the total path length is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total path length for 3 circuits} = 3 \\times \\left( \\frac{8\\pi}{3} + 4 \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n\\text{Total path length for 3 circuits} = 3 \\times \\frac{8\\pi}{3} + 3 \\times 4 = 8\\pi + 12\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Express the total path length in terms of a single fraction\n\nCombine terms:\n\\[\n8\\pi + 12 = \\frac{24\\pi}{3} + \\frac{36}{3} = \\frac{24\\pi + 36}{3} = \\frac{28\\pi}{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe total path length is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{B}}\n\\]",

Since the dashed lines divide the square into 9 equal smaller squares (a \\(3 \\times 3\\) grid), when folded, the smaller square in the center of the original grid is formed by stacking all 9 smaller squares.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Cutting a corner\nOnce the paper is folded into the smaller square, one corner of this smaller square is cut off. Cutting this corner removes a portion of **all the layers of paper** stacked in that position.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Unfolding the paper\nWhen the paper is unfolded, the cut from the folded paper is replicated symmetrically across all the layers that were folded into that position. Each of the 9 smaller squares in the original grid contributes one hole if it corresponds to one of the layers that was cut.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Counting the holes\nSince the paper was folded such that all 9 smaller squares overlapped, and a single cut was made through all the layers, the cut is reflected in all 9 smaller squares when the paper is unfolded.

Since there are \\(15\\) points, each triangle can appear in \\(15\\) different rotations.\n\nThus, we divide the total by \\(15\\) to account for rotational symmetry:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{455}{15} = 30.33\n\\]\n\nHowever, the result is not an integer because not all triangles are distinct under rotation alone. This indicates we need to consider **reflection symmetry** as well.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Accounting for reflections\nEach triangle can also be reflected, which results in additional symmetry. For example, a triangle with vertices \\(A, B, C\\) can appear as \\(C, B, A\\) under reflection. This effectively doubles the symmetry.\n\nUsing **Burnside's Lemma** (a method for counting distinct objects under group actions like rotation and reflection), the correct count of distinct triangles is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Total triangles}}{\\text{Symmetry factor}} = \\boxed{35}\n\\]",

Let's proceed step by step:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current grid components\nThe grid consists of 9 squares, each with some combination of white and black areas. Let's calculate the black and white areas in each square:\n\n1. **Top row**:\n   - Left square: Fully white \u2192 **White: 1, Black: 0**\n   - Middle square: Fully black \u2192 **White: 0, Black: 1**\n   - Right square: Fully black \u2192 **White: 0, Black: 1**\n\n2. **Middle row**:\n   - Left square: Half white, half black (diagonal split) \u2192 **White: 0.5, Black: 0.5**\n   - Middle square: Fully black \u2192 **White: 0, Black: 1**\n   - Right square: Half white, half black (diagonal split) \u2192 **White: 0.5, Black: 0.5**\n\n3. **Bottom row**:\n   - Left square: Half white, half black (horizontal split) \u2192 **White: 0.5, Black: 0.5**\n   - Middle square: Fully white \u2192 **White: 1, Black: 0**\n   - Right square (question mark): Needs to be replaced.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Total the current black and white areas\nSumming up the areas for the fixed squares:\n\n- **White area**:\n  \\( 1 + 0 + 0 + 0.5 + 0 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 3.5 \\)\n\n- **Black area**:\n  \\( 0 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0 = 4.5 \\)\n\nCurrently, the black area is **1.0 larger** than the white area.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine the required replacement square\nTo balance the areas, we need to **reduce the black area by 0.5 and increase the white area by 0.5**. This means the replacement square must have **0.5 black and 0.5 white** areas.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the options\n- **(A)** Fully white \u2192 Adds \\(1\\) to white and \\(0\\) to black.\n- **(B)** Fully black \u2192 Adds \\(0\\) to white and \\(1\\) to black.\n- **(C)** Half white, half black (horizontal split) \u2192 Adds \\(0.5\\) to white and \\(0.5\\) to black.\n- **(D)** Triangle (mostly white with black triangle) \u2192 Adds a fraction, not \\(0.5\\), so not balanced.\n- **(E)** Triangle (mostly black with white triangle) \u2192 Adds a fraction, not \\(0.5\\), so not balanced.\n\nThe only option that works is **(C)**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\(\\boxed{C}\\)",

The unfolded paper reveals four holes, as shown in **image1**. We need to determine the fold line Bob used from the options in **image2**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the position of the holes\nThe unfolded paper in **image1** has four holes arranged in a square pattern. This symmetry indicates that the paper was folded in such a way that the hole-punch created four holes when unfolded. \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Examine the folding options in **image2**\nWe will analyze each folding option and determine whether it can produce the observed pattern of holes:\n\n- **Option (A):** Diagonal fold  \n  Folding along a diagonal line would cause a hole-punch in one quadrant to reflect diagonally across the paper, resulting in only two holes once unfolded (not four).  \n  **This option is incorrect.**\n\n- **Option (B):** Vertical fold into thirds  \n  Folding into thirds along a vertical line does not divide the paper symmetrically into four quadrants. A hole-punch would create an asymmetric pattern, not a square of four holes.  \n  **This option is incorrect.**\n\n- **Option (C):** Horizontal and vertical fold into quarters  \n  Folding along both a horizontal and vertical line to form quarters divides the paper into four equal quadrants. A hole-punch in one quadrant is mirrored into all four quadrants when unfolded. This matches the observed pattern of four holes in a square.  \n  **This option is correct.**\n\n- **Option (D):** Diagonal fold  \n  Similar to option (A), folding along a diagonal line would result in only two holes, not four.  \n  **This option is incorrect.**\n\n- **Option (E):** Vertical fold into thirds  \n  This is the same as option (B) but mirrored. It also creates an asymmetric pattern of holes, not a square of four holes.  \n  **This option is incorrect.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe correct folding line is **option (C)**, where the paper was folded into quarters along both a horizontal and vertical line.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",

The goal is to find two pieces that can fit together to form a perfect square.\n\n#### Observations:\n1. Each square unit in the grid has a side length of 1.\n2. To form a square, the two pieces must combine to form a shape with equal width and height.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the combined area of two pieces\nA square has an area equal to its side length squared. Thus, to form a square, the total area of the two pieces must be a perfect square.\n\n#### Piece Areas:\n- Piece 1: 5 square units\n- Piece 2: 7 square units\n- Piece 3: 9 square units\n- Piece 4: 4 square units\n\nNow, we calculate the combined area for each pair of pieces and check whether it forms a perfect square:\n- \\(1 + 2 = 5 + 7 = 12\\) (Not a perfect square)\n- \\(1 + 3 = 5 + 9 = 14\\) (Not a perfect square)\n- \\(2 + 3 = 7 + 9 = 16\\) (Perfect square, \\(4 \\times 4\\))\n- \\(2 + 4 = 7 + 4 = 11\\) (Not a perfect square)\n- \\(1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9\\) (Perfect square, \\(3 \\times 3\\))\n\n### Step 3: Verify the shape of the square\nNext, we determine which of the valid combinations (2 + 3 and 1 + 4) can form a square.

Let\u2019s go step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the board and the shapes\nThe board has a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid, but some squares are already filled, making it partially occupied. The remaining unoccupied squares are available for placement.\n\nThe five shapes (A, B, C, D, E) consist of four-unit blocks arranged in different patterns. For each option, we will:\n1.

If placed strategically, it could leave space for another shape to fit. For example, placing it in the bottom-left corner leaves room for other shapes (e.g., C or D). Thus, **A is not the answer**.\n\n#### **Option B**:\nShape B is a \"cross\" shape. It occupies a significant area in the center of the board. However, no matter how it is placed, it typically leaves space for other shapes to fit. Thus, **B is not the answer**.\n\n#### **Option C**:\nShape C is a vertical straight line of four blocks. If placed, it leaves enough space for smaller shapes like A, D, or E to fit on the board. Thus, **C is not the answer**.\n\n#### **Option D**:\nShape D is a \"T\" shape. If placed strategically, it will leave space for other shapes, such as A or C. Thus, **D is not the answer**.\n\n#### **Option E**:\nShape E is a \"Z\" shape. If placed in the bottom-left corner, it divides the remaining space into awkward configurations that do not allow any of the other shapes (A, B, C, or D) to fit. This makes E the correct choice.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm the answer\nBy placing shape E on the board, none of the remaining four shapes (A, B, C, D) can fit into the leftover spaces.

The total area is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total area} = \\text{Area of square} + \\text{Area of all rectangles}.\n\\]\n\nSince the total area of the figure is assembled into one long rectangle with a width of **8 cm**, we focus on finding the combined length of all the parts.\n\n#### Step 4: Combine the lengths of all parts\nThe total area of the figure is equal to the area of the final long rectangle, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of long rectangle} = \\text{Width} \\times \\text{Length}.\n\\]\n\nLet the length of the long rectangle be \\(L\\). Then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total area} = 8 \\times L.\n\\]\n\nWe now calculate the total length of all the parts by summing their individual contributions.\n\n1. The **square** contributes a length of \\(8\\) cm (since its width is 8 cm and its area is 64 cm\u00b2).\n2. Each of the **eight rectangles** contributes its full length. Since the entire figure is rearranged, the lengths of all eight rectangles are also combined.\n\nBy observing the figure, we see that the total combined length of all the parts is **\\(8 \\times 8 + 64\\)**",

The bottom row now ends up on top of the previous layers.\n- **First vertical fold**: Fold the right column to the left, covering the left column.

Two diagonal axes (splits the grid diagonally).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Current Setup\nThe current grid has **2 shaded squares** in the upper-left quadrant. To achieve 4 axes of symmetry, the design must be symmetric along all four axes. This means we must mirror the existing green squares across all axes.\n\nThe grid is \\(6 \\times 6\\), so the center of symmetry lies at the center of the grid.\n\n### Step 3: Mirror the Existing Squares\n- **Step 3.1: Vertical Symmetry**\n  - To achieve vertical symmetry, the two existing green squares in the top-left quadrant must be mirrored to the top-right quadrant:\n    - The square at (1,1) mirrors to (1,6).\n    - The square at (1,2) mirrors to (1,5).\n\n- **Step 3.2: Horizontal Symmetry**\n  - To achieve horizontal symmetry, the original squares and their vertical mirrors must also be mirrored downward:\n    - The square at (1,1) mirrors to (6,1).\n    - The square at (1,2) mirrors to (6,2).\n    - The square at (1,6) mirrors to (6,6).\n    - The square at (1,5) mirrors to (6,5).\n\n- **Step 3.3: Diagonal Symmetry**\n  - The design already achieves diagonal symmetry due to mirroring along both the vertical and horizontal axes.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Squares Added\nThe original diagram has 2 shaded squares.

These holes allow specific numbers on the watch face to be visible.\n2. The disc can be rotated, but the relative positions of the holes to each other do not change.\n3. The goal is to identify the numbers that align with the three holes simultaneously when the disc is placed on the clock.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the given diagram\n- In the diagram, the dark disc shows three numbers: **1**, **2**, and **9**, which correspond to the positions of the three holes.\n- These numbers represent the positions on the watch face that align with the holes in the disc.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Rotate the disc\n- When the disc rotates around its center, the numbers on the watch face that align with the holes will change.\n- The relative positions of the three numbers will remain consistent. Specifically:\n    - The top hole aligns with 1 initially.\n    - The bottom-left hole aligns with 2 initially.\n    - The bottom-right hole aligns with 9 initially.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Check the options\nFrom the options given:\n- **Option A (4, 6, and 12):**\n  These numbers are not aligned with the holes in any rotation.\n\n- **Option B (1, 5, and 10):**\n  When the disc is rotated such that the holes align with 1, 5, and 10, these numbers can be visible simultaneously.\n\n- **Option C (2, 4, and 9):**\n  These numbers are not aligned with the holes in any rotation.\n\n- **Option D (3, 6, and 9):**\n  These numbers are not aligned with the holes in any rotation.\n\n- **Option E (5, 7, and 12):**\n  These numbers are not aligned with the holes in any rotation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe correct answer is **Option B** (1, 5, and 10).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",

The smaller figures (three-square and four-square) can be rotated but not flipped.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the shapes and their constraints\n1. **Three-square figure**: This is an \"L\"-shaped figure with 3 squares in total.\n2. **Four-square figure**: This is a \"T\"-shaped figure with 4 squares in total.\n\nThe larger figure on the left is a grid with 20 squares (4 rows \u00d7 5 columns). We are tasked to cover the entire 20-square figure using the smallest number of three-square figures. The four-square figures can also be used, but the focus is on minimizing the number of three-square figures.\n\n### Step 3: Strategy for solving\nTo minimize the number of three-square figures:\n1. First, try to maximize the use of the four-square figures, since they cover more area.\n2. Use the three-square figures to fill in any remaining uncovered squares.\n\n### Step 4: Place the four-square figures\nA four-square figure covers 4 squares. Divide the total number of squares (20) by 4:\n\\[\n20 \\div 4 = 5\n\\]\nThis suggests that, in theory, 5 four-square figures could cover the larger figure. However, the shape of the grid and constraints of the four-square figure make it impossible to fit 5 of them without overlapping or leaving gaps.\n\nThrough trial and error, **4 four-square figures** can be placed, covering 16 squares. This leaves:\n\\[\n20 - 16 = 4 \\text{ uncovered squares.}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Fill the remaining squares with three-square figures\nA three-square figure covers 3 squares. To cover the remaining 4 squares, at least **2 three-square figures** are needed (since each figure can only cover 3 squares, and overlapping is not allowed).\n\n### Step 6: Verify the solution\nUsing 4 four-square figures and 2 three-square figures:\n- Four-square figures cover \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) squares.\n- Two three-square figures cover \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) squares.\n- Total squares covered: \\(16 + 6 = 22\\), which exceeds 20.\n\nTo minimize the number of three-square figures, we must adjust:\n- Use 3 four-square figures to cover \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) squares.\n- Use 3 three-square figures to cover \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) squares.\n- Total squares covered: \\(12 + 9 = 20\\), which matches the required total.\n\n### Step 7: Final answer\nThe smallest number of three-square figures needed is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

The triangles \\( \\triangle ABC \\) and \\( \\triangle ACD \\) are equilateral triangles.\n2. Triangle \\( \\triangle ACD \\) is rotated counterclockwise about \\( A \\), and we need to determine the first angle at which it coincides with \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n### Step 1: Symmetry of an equilateral triangle\nAn equilateral triangle has rotational symmetry of \\( 120^\\circ \\). This means that if an equilateral triangle is rotated about one of its vertices by \\( 120^\\circ \\), \\( 240^\\circ \\), or \\( 360^\\circ \\), it maps onto itself. For the given problem, the rotation must be such that \\( \\triangle ACD \\) aligns exactly with \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n### Step 2: How rotation aligns the triangles\n- Initially, \\( \\triangle ACD \\) is positioned so that \\( A \\) is fixed, and \\( AC \\) is a common side of both triangles.\n- If we rotate \\( \\triangle ACD \\) counterclockwise about \\( A \\), vertex \\( D \\) will move toward \\( B \\), and vertex \\( C \\) will remain in place.\n- The first position where \\( \\triangle ACD \\) coincides with \\( \\triangle ABC \\) occurs when \\( D \\) reaches \\( B \\).\n\n### Step 3: Compute the rotation angle\nFor \\( D \\) to reach \\( B \\), \\( \\triangle ACD \\) must be rotated by \\( 120^\\circ \\) counterclockwise about \\( A \\). At this angle:\n- \\( D \\) moves to \\( B \\),\n- \\( C \\) remains fixed at its original position, and\n- \\( \\triangle ACD \\) perfectly overlaps \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\nThus, the first angle at which \\( \\triangle ACD \\) coincides with \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is \\( \\boxed{B} \\).",

A regular hexagon has all its sides equal and all its internal angles equal to \\(120^\\circ\\).

Let\u2019s analyze each option step by step:\n\n---\n\n### **Option A: Trapezium**\n- A trapezium (or trapezoid) is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides.\n- In a regular hexagon, we can form a trapezium by connecting four vertices such that two of the opposite sides are parallel. For instance, consider vertices \\(A, B, E, F\\) (where \\(A, B, C, D, E, F\\) are consecutive vertices of the hexagon).

For instance, consider the vertices corresponding to one side of the hexagon and the center of the hexagon. The center forms a \\(90^\\circ\\) angle at the base.\n- **A right-angled triangle can be generated.**\n\n---\n\n### **Option C: Square**\n- A square is a quadrilateral with all sides equal and all angles equal to \\(90^\\circ\\).\n- In a regular hexagon, it is impossible to form a square because the angles between the vertices are constrained to multiples of \\(60^\\circ\\). Therefore, we cannot create a quadrilateral with \\(90^\\circ\\) angles.\n- **A square cannot be generated.**\n\n---\n\n### **Option D: Kite**\n- A kite is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides equal.\n- In a regular hexagon, we can form a kite by connecting four vertices appropriately.

The sides \\(AB = BE\\) and \\(AD = DE\\) form a kite.\n- **A kite can be generated.**\n\n---\n\n### **Option E: Obtuse Triangle**\n- An obtuse triangle is a triangle with one angle greater than \\(90^\\circ\\).\n- In a regular hexagon, we can form an obtuse triangle by connecting three vertices appropriately.

Because the original string was folded, the cuts yield pieces that are multiples of the smallest segment length.\n\n- Let the total length of the original string be \\( L \\).\n- After three folds, the smallest segment length is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Smallest segment length} = \\frac{L}{8}.\n  \\]\n- The resulting pieces are either \\( 4 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\) or \\( 9 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\).\n\nThis means that \\( \\frac{L}{8} \\) must be a divisor of both \\( 4 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\) and \\( 9 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\), because all pieces are formed by combining multiples of \\( \\frac{L}{8} \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Finding possible values of \\( \\frac{L}{8} \\)\nThe two given lengths, \\( 4 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\) and \\( 9 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\), must be integer multiples of \\( \\frac{L}{8} \\). Let \\( \\frac{L}{8} = d \\).

    "response": "To determine which of the line segments \\(a, b, c, d, e\\) is the longest, we analyze the areas of the triangles and recognize that the area of a triangle is proportional to its base length when the height is constant. Since the diagonal of the square serves as a common base for the triangles, the length of each segment of the diagonal is proportional to the area of the triangle formed with it.\n\n### Step 1: Total Area of the Square\nThe area of the square is given as \\(30 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\). The diagonal splits the square into two equal triangles, so the area of each of these large triangles is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of each large triangle} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15 \\, \\text{cm}^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Area of the Triangles Along the Diagonal\nThe diagonal is divided into segments \\(a, b, c, d, e\\), and the areas of the triangles formed by these segments are labeled in the diagram:\n- Triangle corresponding to \\(a\\): \\(2 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\),\n- Triangle corresponding to \\(b\\): \\(5 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\),\n- Triangle corresponding to \\(c\\): Unknown,\n- Triangle corresponding to \\(d\\): \\(4 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\),\n- Triangle corresponding to \\(e\\): \\(9 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the Missing Area\nThe sum of the areas of all triangles along the diagonal must equal the total area of one large triangle, \\(15 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\). Adding the given areas:\n\\[\n2 + 5 + 4 + 9 = 20 \\, \\text{cm}^2.\n\\]\nThis sum exceeds \\(15 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\), but the overlapping triangle (corresponding to \\(c\\)) has been double-counted. Let the area of \\(c\\) be \\(x\\). The correct equation is:\n\\[\n2 + 5 + x + 4 + 9 = 15 + x.\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n20 = 15 + x \\implies x = 5 \\, \\text{cm}^2.\n\\]\nThus, the area of the triangle corresponding to \\(c\\) is \\(5 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\).\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Segment Lengths\nThe length of each segment of the diagonal is proportional to the area of the triangle associated with it. Therefore, we compare the areas:\n- Segment \\(a\\): \\(2 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\),\n- Segment \\(b\\): \\(5 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\),\n- Segment \\(c\\): \\(5 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\),\n- Segment \\(d\\): \\(4 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\),\n- Segment \\(e\\): \\(9 \\, \\text{cm}^2\\).\n\nThe largest area corresponds to segment \\(e\\), so \\(e\\) is the longest segment.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{e}\n\\]",

This is crucial because the relative spacing between the two holes remains constant as the disc is rotated.\n\n### Step 3: Rotating the disc\nThe problem states that the dark disc is rotated so that the number **8** is now visible through one of the holes. Since the spacing between the two holes remains constant (8 positions), the number visible through the other hole will be the number 8 positions away from 8.\n\n### Step 4: Counting 8 positions from 8\nTo find the number 8 positions away from 8:\n1.

Specifically, the area of each piece must divide \\(24\\) without a remainder.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Area of each shape\nWe calculate the area of each given shape:\n\n- **(A)**: A \\(2 \\times 2\\) square has an area of:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ unit squares.}\n  \\]\n- **(B)**: The \"L\" shape consists of \\(4\\) unit squares.\n- **(C)**: Another \"L\" shape (rotated) also consists of \\(4\\) unit squares.\n- **(D)**: A \"T\" shape constructed from \\(4\\) unit squares.\n- **(E)**: A \\(1 \\times 4\\) straight piece has an area of:\n  \\[\n  1 \\times 4 = 4 \\text{ unit squares.}\n  \\]\n\nThus, all shapes have an area of \\(4\\) unit squares.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Divisibility of the grid's area\nThe total area of the grid is \\(24\\), and each shape has an area of \\(4\\).

The area of a general quadrilateral can be computed as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height}.\n\\]\n\nHere, the height \\(h\\) is the vertical distance between the two parallel lines, which is the same for all strips.

The sheet is folded along its diagonal, creating a triangle that overlaps part of the rectangle. The parts of the triangle that stick out (shaded in the diagram) are cut off. When the paper is unfolded, it forms a rhombus.\n\nWe aim to find the length of a side of the rhombus. \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the geometry after folding\nWhen the rectangle is folded along its diagonal, the diagonal divides it into two congruent right triangles. The diagonal of the rectangle serves as the hypotenuse of these triangles. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the diagonal is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Diagonal} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 144} = \\sqrt{180} = 6\\sqrt{5}.\n\\]\n\nThis diagonal becomes one of the diagonals of the rhombus.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Understand the rhombus\nIn a rhombus:\n1. The diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n2. The diagonals divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.\n3. The sides of the rhombus can be found using the relationship between the diagonals.\n\nFrom the problem description, the second diagonal of the rhombus is the width of the rectangle, which is \\(6\\). Therefore, the diagonals of the rhombus are:\n\\[\nd_1 = 6\\sqrt{5}, \\quad d_2 = 6.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Use the diagonals to find the side length\nIn a rhombus, the side length \\(s\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{d_1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{d_2}{2}\\right)^2}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(d_1 = 6\\sqrt{5}\\) and \\(d_2 = 6\\):\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{6\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{6}{2}\\right)^2}.\n\\]\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\left(3\\sqrt{5}\\right)^2 + 3^2}.\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{45 + 9}.\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{54}.\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns = 3\\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3\\sqrt{6}}\n\\]",

The square has side length 10, and it rolls without slipping.\n2. Point \\( P \\) is at one corner of the square.\n3. The rolling stops when \\( P \\) first returns to the line.\n\nDuring one complete roll, the square rotates through \\( 360^\\circ \\) (one full revolution), and the point \\( P \\) traces a curve called a **cycloid**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the motion of \\( P \\)\nAs the square rolls:\n1. The square rotates about its bottom corner.\n2. Point \\( P \\) undergoes two types of motion:\n   - A **circular arc motion** about the bottom corner, when \\( P \\) moves from the bottom edge to the top edge of the square.\n   - A **linear displacement** due to the rolling of the square.\n\nThe complete curve traced by \\( P \\) consists of four identical segments (one for each side of the square).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Length of one segment of the curve\nLet us compute the length of the curve traced by \\( P \\) during its motion along one side of the square:\n\n#### (a) Circular arc length for one side:\n- The rotation of the square about its corner causes \\( P \\) to trace a quarter-circle.\n- The radius of this quarter-circle is the side length of the square: \\( r = 10 \\).\n- The length of a quarter-circle is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Circular arc length} = \\frac{1}{4}(2\\pi r) = \\frac{1}{4}(2\\pi \\cdot 10) = 5\\pi.\n  \\]\n\n#### (b) Linear distance for one side:\n- As the square rolls, the bottom edge of the square moves a distance equal to the side length of the square: \\( 10 \\).\n- This contributes additional displacement to the curve traced by \\( P \\), but it is not directly added to the arc length because the curve is traced as a combination of the circular motion and rolling motion.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Total curve length for one revolution\nSince the curve is traced over four sides of the square, the total length of the curve is four times the length of one segment:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length} = 4 \\times (\\text{Circular arc length} + \\text{Linear distance}).\n\\]\n\n#### (a) Circular arc contribution:\nEach side contributes \\( 5\\pi \\) from the quarter-circle arc.

The task is to figure out the trajectory of the **center of the wheel** as the wheel moves. \n\nThe wheel is circular, so its center will always be a fixed distance (the radius of the wheel) above the point of contact between the wheel and the curve.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Observing the path of the wheel**\n- The wheel rolls on a path that alternates between slanted lines and sharp \"V\" shapes.\n- As the wheel moves:\n  - On an upward or downward slant, the center of the wheel will follow a parallel trajectory at a constant height (the radius of the wheel).\n  - At the sharp corners (the \"V\" points), the center of the wheel will make a smooth, rounded transition due to the circular motion of the wheel.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Eliminate incorrect options**\n- **Option A**: This path shows sharp points at the corners of the zigzag. This is incorrect because the center of the wheel would move smoothly, not sharply, at the transitions.\n- **Option B**: This curve shows flat horizontal sections for the center of the wheel at the \"V\" points. This is incorrect because the center of the wheel would not remain stationary or move horizontally at those points.\n- **Option C**: This path shows a smooth curve that correctly follows the trajectory of the center of the wheel as it transitions smoothly from one peak to the next. This is a valid candidate.\n- **Option D**: This curve shows rounded transitions, but the curve does not correctly align with the slant of the original zigzag path. This is incorrect.\n- **Option E**: This path is similar to Option D and does not correctly represent the trajectory of the center of the wheel.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Correct answer**\nThe correct curve is shown in **Option C**, as it accurately represents the smooth trajectory of the center of the wheel as it rolls along the zigzag path.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\\(\\boxed{C}\\)",

The circle has a radius of \\( 1 \\), and it is divided into three equal sectors of \\( 120^\\circ \\) each, colored differently. The circle rolls without slipping, so the distance it rolls corresponds to the rotation of the circle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Circumference\nThe circumference of the circle is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Circumference} = 2\\pi \\cdot \\text{radius} = 2\\pi \\cdot 1 = 2\\pi.\n\\]\n\nThis means that for every full rotation, the circle rolls a distance of \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of Full Rotations\nThe total distance the circle rolls is \\( 11\\pi \\). To find the number of full rotations, divide \\( 11\\pi \\) by the circumference \\( 2\\pi \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Number of full rotations} = \\frac{11\\pi}{2\\pi} = 5.5.\n\\]\n\nThis means the circle completes \\( 5 \\) full rotations and an additional \\( 0.5 \\) (half) of a rotation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Extra Half Rotation\n- A full rotation corresponds to \\( 360^\\circ \\), so half a rotation corresponds to \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n- Initially, the black sector is at the bottom (as shown in the diagram). After \\( 5 \\) full rotations, the circle returns to the same orientation as it started.\n- The additional \\( 0.5 \\) rotation shifts the circle by \\( 180^\\circ \\), moving the black sector from the bottom to the top.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Match the Final Position to the Choices\nAfter rolling \\( 11\\pi \\), the black sector is at the top, which corresponds to option **(B)**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",

Let\u2019s break it down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nEach square has a side length of \\(1 \\, \\text{cm}\\). The perimeter of a figure depends on how the squares are arranged. Squares joined along their edges share sides, reducing the total perimeter. To maximize the perimeter, we need to minimize the number of shared sides.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Strategy to Maximize the Perimeter\nTo maximize the perimeter:\n- Minimize the amount of shared edges between squares.\n- Arrange the squares so that as many sides as possible are exposed.\n\nThe configuration that maximizes the perimeter is a straight line of 9 squares, as this arrangement minimizes shared edges.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Perimeter for a Straight Line\n1. In a straight-line arrangement:\n   - Each square contributes 4 sides (initially), but squares that are adjacent share 1 side with their neighbor.\n   - For 9 squares in a straight line:\n     - The first square has 4 sides.\n     - Each of the next 8 squares shares 1 side with its neighbor, contributing only 3 additional sides each.\n   - Total perimeter:\n     \\[\n     4 + 3 \\times 8 = 4 + 24 = 28 \\, \\text{cm}.\n     \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Verifying Other Configurations\nLet\u2019s consider other possible configurations:\n1. **Compact configurations (e.g., a 3x3 square):**\n   - A 3x3 square has 9 squares, with many shared edges.\n   - Total perimeter:\n     - The outer edges of the 3x3 square form a single boundary with 12 sides.\n     - Each side is \\(1 \\, \\text{cm}\\), so the perimeter is:\n       \\[\n       4 \\times 3 = 12 \\, \\text{cm}.\n       \\]\n\n2. **Other irregular shapes:**\n   - Any shape that is not a straight line will have more shared edges than the straight-line configuration. Thus, its perimeter will be less than \\(28 \\, \\text{cm}\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe maximum perimeter is achieved when the 9 squares are arranged in a straight line, and the perimeter is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20 \\text{ cm}}",

The right diagram shows a dark disc with two holes. One hole currently reveals the number 1, and the other hole reveals the number 9. \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the position of the holes on the dark disc\nThe two holes are fixed on the dark disc, and their positions relative to each other will not change. From the given setup:\n- One hole reveals the number 1.\n- The other hole reveals the number 9.\n\nThis means the two holes are **separated by 8 units** on the circular dial (e.g., counting clockwise from 1 to 9: 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 4 \u2192 5 \u2192 6 \u2192 7 \u2192 8 \u2192 9).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Rotate the disc so \"10\" is visible\nNow, we rotate the dark disc so that the number 10 is visible through the hole that originally revealed the number 1. Since the two holes are separated by 8 units, the second hole will now reveal the number that is **8 units clockwise** from 10.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Count 8 units clockwise from 10\nCounting clockwise from 10:\n- 10 \u2192 11 \u2192 12 \u2192 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 4 \u2192 5 \u2192 6.\n\nAfter 8 steps, we land on **6**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Confirm the numbers visible through the holes\nWhen the dark disc is rotated:\n- One hole reveals the number 10.\n- The other hole reveals the number 6.\n\nThus, the numbers visible are **10 and 6**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Match the answer to the options\nThe correct answer is **option C: 3 and 6**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\(\\boxed{C}\\)",

The box is a \\( 5 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 5 \\, \\text{cm} \\) square, and each bar is \\( 1 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\). Since there are already 7 bars in the box, adding one more bar requires rearranging the existing bars to free up the necessary space.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the space required for one more bar\nEach bar occupies an area of \\( 1 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 3 \\, \\text{cm} = 3 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\). To fit one more bar, we need to create a free rectangular space of \\( 1 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\) within the \\( 5 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 5 \\, \\text{cm} \\) box.\n\n### Step 2: Examine the arrangement of bars\nFrom the diagram:\n1. The box is fully occupied by the 7 bars, with no unused space.\n2. To make room for one more bar, we need to **shift some bars** to create a free \\( 1 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\) space.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the bars to move\nBy observing the arrangement:\n1. The **top two bars** (in the first row) can be shifted to the left or right to free up a space in the top row.\n2. These two bars are sufficient to create the required \\( 1 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\) space.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the minimum number of moves\nTo create the necessary space:\n- The **top-left bar** can be moved to the left.\n- The adjacent bar in the top row can also be shifted slightly to align with the first bar.\n\nThus, **only two bars need to be moved** to create the free space.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",

Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the empty space\nThe given \\(5 \\times 5\\) board has some squares already filled with dark gray. The empty region is an \\(L\\)-shaped area consisting of 8 squares (5 on the bottom row and 3 on the rightmost column).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Match the shapes to the empty area\nWe need to check each of the five shapes (A-E) and see if it can fit into the empty space. The shapes are:\n\n- **A**: A \"T\"-shaped figure of 4 squares.\n- **B**: A \"+\"-shaped figure of 5 squares.\n- **C**: A vertical column of 4 squares.\n- **D**: A \"Z\"-shaped figure of 4 squares.\n- **E**: A square block of 4 squares.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine which shape to place\nWe aim to place one shape so that the remaining empty space cannot accommodate any of the other shapes (even when rotated or flipped). Now, let's evaluate each option:\n\n#### **Option A**\n- Place shape A in the empty space. After placing, the remaining empty space is irregular and consists of 4 squares. \n- Shape **E** (a square block of 4 squares) can fit into the remaining space. \n- Hence, **A** is not the correct answer.\n\n#### **Option B**\n- Place shape B in the empty space.

After placing, the remaining empty space consists of 4 squares in an irregular pattern.\n- Shape **E** (a square block of 4 squares) can fit into the remaining space.\n- Hence, **C** is not the correct answer.\n\n#### **Option D**\n- Place shape D in the empty space. After placing, the remaining empty space consists of 4 squares in an irregular pattern.\n- Shape **E** (a square block of 4 squares) can fit into the remaining space.\n- Hence, **D** is not the correct answer.\n\n#### **Option E**\n- Place shape E in the empty space.

Placing **B** in the empty space ensures that none of the other shapes can fit in the remaining space.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",

    "response": "### Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem involves a composite shape (constructed from two rectangles) that is cut into three parts and rearranged to form a triangle. The goal is to find the length \\(x\\), which is the height of the composite shape.\n\n### Step 2: Key observations\n1. The composite shape consists of two rectangles with side lengths \\(11\\) and \\(13\\).\n2. The diagonal lines divide the rectangles into parts that are rearranged into a triangle.\n3. The triangle formed after rearrangement must have its sides preserved from the composite shape.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem\nThe diagonal lines in the composite shape represent the hypotenuses of right triangles formed by the rectangle edges. Let\u2019s calculate the lengths of these diagonals.\n\n#### Diagonal of the first rectangle\nFor the rectangle with side lengths \\(11\\) and \\(x\\), the diagonal is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Diagonal}_1 = \\sqrt{11^2 + x^2}\n\\]\n\n#### Diagonal of the second rectangle\nFor the rectangle with side lengths \\(13\\) and \\(x - 11\\) (since the difference in height is \\(x - 11\\)), the diagonal is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Diagonal}_2 = \\sqrt{13^2 + (x - 11)^2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Total length of the triangle\u2019s hypotenuse\nThe hypotenuse of the triangle formed by rearranging the parts must equal the total diagonal length in the original shape. Hence, the total hypotenuse is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hypotenuse} = \\text{Diagonal}_1 + \\text{Diagonal}_2\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\(x\\)\nThe problem asks for the length \\(x\\). To solve for \\(x\\), observe the geometric relationships in the rearranged triangle. Since the problem does not provide additional constraints, the composite shape implies that \\(x\\) must satisfy the relationship between the two diagonals.\n\nBy observation and geometry, the height \\(x\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]",

Since the markings above the fold will appear the other way up when folded, the first digit in the completed number contains a vertical line top left and a vertical line bottom right in addition to the three horizontal lines and so is a 5. The second digit in the completed number contains a double length vertical line on the left and a vertical line bottom right in addition to the three horizontal lines and so is a 6. Similarly, the third digit in the completed number contains a double length vertical line on the right and a vertical line top left in addition to the three horizontal lines and so is a 9 . Therefore the number that will be seen is 569 .",

The goal is to calculate the sum of the areas of the two shaded rectangles in the final folded shape.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Dimensions of the original square\nThe area of the square is \\( 64 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\). Since the area of a square is given by \\( \\text{side}^2 \\), we can calculate the side length of the square:\n\n\\[\n\\text{side length} = \\sqrt{64} = 8 \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the original square has a side length of \\( 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: First fold\nThe first fold cuts the square diagonally into two congruent right triangles. The area of each triangle is half the area of the original square:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of each triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 64 = 32 \\, \\text{cm}^2.\n\\]\n\nEach triangle has a base and height equal to \\( 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\), since the diagonal of the square divides it symmetrically.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Second fold\nAfter the second fold, one of the triangles is folded to form the two shaded rectangles. Let us analyze the geometry of this fold:\n\n1.

To check if a parallelogram can be formed:\n- Check combinations of four points to see if opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.\n- By inspection, the points (2, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), and (3, 1) form a parallelogram:\n  - (2, 4) \u2192 (4, 3) is parallel to (3, 1) \u2192 (5, 2), and\n  - (2, 4) \u2192 (3, 1) is parallel to (4, 3) \u2192 (5, 2).\nThus, **a parallelogram can be formed.**\n\n#### B: Trapezium\nA trapezium (or trapezoid) is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides.\n- Check combinations of four points to see if at least one pair of opposite sides is parallel.\n- For example, the points (1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 2), and (6, 4) form a trapezium:\n  - (1, 2) \u2192 (5, 2) is parallel to (3, 1) \u2192 (6, 4).\nThus, **a trapezium can be formed.**\n\n#### C: Right-angled triangle\nA right-angled triangle has one angle that is \\(90^\\circ\\). To check:\n- Calculate the slopes of pairs of lines joining three points. If the product of two slopes is \\(-1\\), the triangle is right-angled.\n- For example, the points (1, 2), (3, 1), and (5, 2) form a right-angled triangle:\n  - Slope of (1, 2) \u2192 (3, 1) = \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\),\n  - Slope of (3, 1) \u2192 (5, 2) = \\(+\\frac{1}{2}\\),\n  - Product of slopes = \\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = -1\\).\nThus, **a right-angled triangle can be formed.**\n\n#### D: Obtuse-angled triangle\nAn obtuse-angled triangle has one angle greater than \\(90^\\circ\\).

The midpoint of the wheel moves up and down relative to the curve as the wheel rolls over the peaks and dips of the zig-zag path.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Behavior of the midpoint of the wheel**\n- **At a peak:** When the wheel is at the peak of the zig-zag curve, the midpoint of the wheel is above the peak by the radius of the wheel.\n- **At a dip:** When the wheel is in a dip, the midpoint of the wheel is above the dip by the radius of the wheel.\n- **Midpoint locus:** The midpoint follows a smooth curve that is offset vertically from the zig-zag curve by the radius of the wheel.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Eliminating incorrect options**\n- **Option A:** This shows a smooth curve, but it does not align correctly with the pattern of the zig-zag surface. The midpoint of the wheel would not follow this path.\n- **Option B:** This path aligns correctly with the zig-zag structure of the curve. It is a smooth curve offset vertically from the zig-zag surface by the radius of the wheel. This is a valid candidate.\n- **Option C:** This shows a path that is too flat and does not resemble the correct smooth shape aligned with the zig-zag curve.\n- **Option D:** This path mirrors the zig-zag curve and is sharp, which is not consistent with the smooth rolling motion of the wheel.\n- **Option E:** This path is also sharp like the zig-zag curve and does not match the smooth motion of the midpoint.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Selecting the correct locus**\nThe only option that matches the expected smooth, vertically offset curve of the midpoint is **Option B**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\\(\\boxed{B}\\)",

    "response": "Let us solve this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the symmetry condition\nThe array consists of 13 squares arranged in the given shape. The central square does not change under any rotation. However, the other 12 squares are organized into four groups of three squares, each group forming an \"L\" shape. The arrangement is symmetric under a 90\u00b0 rotation around the central square.\n\nFor the coloring to remain the same after a 90\u00b0 rotation:\n1. Each \"L\" must have the same coloring as the others.\n2. Specifically, the squares in corresponding positions within each \"L\" (e.g., top-left square of one \"L\") must have the same color.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Total number of colorings\nThere are 13 squares, and we need to color 8 red and 5 blue. The total number of possible colorings is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{13}{8} = \\binom{13}{5} = \\frac{13!}{8! \\cdot 5!} = \\frac{13 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9}{5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 1287.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Counting symmetric colorings\nTo satisfy the symmetry condition, the colorings of the four \"L\" shapes must be identical. Each \"L\" contains three squares, so we are effectively coloring these three squares, and the pattern is repeated four times.\n\n#### Step 3.1: Coloring one \"L\"\nEach \"L\" can have between 0 and 3 red squares. Let us calculate the number of symmetric configurations for each case:\n\n1. **0 red squares (all blue):**\n   There is only 1 way to color one \"L\" with all blue squares. The same pattern is repeated in all four \"L\"s.\n\n2. **1 red square and 2 blue squares:**\n   There are \\(\\binom{3}{1} = 3\\) ways to choose 1 red square and 2 blue squares for one \"L.\" However, all four \"L\"s must have the same configuration, so there is only 1 symmetric way.\n\n3. **2 red squares and 1 blue square:**\n   Similarly, there are \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) ways to choose 2 red squares and 1 blue square for one \"L.\" Again, all four \"L\"s must have the same configuration, so there is only 1 symmetric way.\n\n4. **3 red squares (all red):**\n   There is only 1 way to color one \"L\" with all red squares. The same pattern is repeated in all four \"L\"s.\n\n#### Step 3.2: Checking total counts\nThe number of symmetric colorings is determined by ensuring the total number of red and blue squares sums to 8 and 5, respectively. Let us consider each valid case:\n\n1. **0 red squares per \"L\":**\n   Total red squares = \\(0 \\cdot 4 = 0\\) (not valid).\n\n2. **1 red square per \"L\":**\n   Total red squares = \\(1 \\cdot 4 = 4\\) (not valid).\n\n3. **2 red squares per \"L\":**\n   Total red squares = \\(2 \\cdot 4 = 8\\) (valid). There is 1 symmetric way.\n\n4. **3 red squares per \"L\":**\n   Total red squares = \\(3 \\cdot 4 = 12\\) (not valid).\n\nThus, there is only **1 symmetric coloring**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Probability of symmetry\nThe probability of selecting a symmetric coloring is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of symmetric colorings}}{\\text{Total number of colorings}} = \\frac{1}{1287}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final answer\nThe value of \\(n\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1287}\n\\]",

For an arrangement to remain unchanged under this rotation:\n- All 3 disks in the bottom triangle must be the same color,\n- The top disk must have a different color.\n\nThis is impossible because we have 3 blue, 2 red, and 1 green disk, meaning there aren\u2019t enough disks of the same color to satisfy this condition.\n\nThus, no arrangements are unchanged under a 120\u00b0 or 240\u00b0 rotation.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fixed arrangements under 120\u00b0 or 240\u00b0 rotation} = 0.\n\\]\n\n#### (c) Reflections\nThere are 3 reflection axes.

For this to happen:\n\n1. **Condition for the center square to be filled**:\n   - The center square must be **empty initially**.\n   - It must have **exactly 3 filled neighbors**.\n\n2. **Condition for all other squares to be empty**:\n   - If a square is initially filled, it must have fewer than 2 or more than 3 filled neighbors.\n   - If a square is initially empty, it must not have exactly 3 filled neighbors.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Focus on the \\(3 \\times 3\\) subgrid\n\nThe \\(3 \\times 3\\) subgrid has 9 squares. The outer \\(8\\) squares are the neighbors of the center square.

None of the 3 chosen filled squares can remain filled, because each will have exactly 2 neighbors (including the center square). Hence, they will become empty.\n3. All other squares (including the remaining 5 outer squares and the center square itself) will either remain empty or become empty.\n\nThus, all 56 configurations satisfy the conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Account for rotations and reflections\nRotations and reflections of the same configuration are **considered different**, so no further adjustments are needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{56}\n\\]",

Let\u2019s classify the patterns based on their symmetry:\n\n#### (a) **Two squares are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally):**\n- A pair of adjacent squares can be positioned in 4 horizontal pairs, 4 vertical pairs, and 4 diagonal pairs. However, all adjacent pairs are equivalent under rotation and reflection.\n- Therefore, **all adjacent pairs form one unique pattern**.\n\n#### (b) **Two squares are on the same row or column but not adjacent:**\n- For a row or column, there are 3 ways to pick two non-adjacent squares.

This is evident from the symmetry.\n\n- Total area of the square: \\( A = 1 \\).\n- Shaded area: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Comparison of Shaded Areas**\n- Shaded area in **Figure I**: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n- Shaded area in **Figure II**: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n- Shaded area in **Figure III**: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nFrom this, we see that the shaded areas of **Figure I** and **Figure III** are equal, while the shaded area of **Figure II** is smaller.\n\n---\n\n### **Answer**\nThe correct choice is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n\\]",

Carefully analyzing the folding and unfolding process step by step will help us arrive at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Initial Fold (Bottom to Top)**\n\n- The rectangular paper is folded **bottom to top** along the horizontal dashed line. \n- After this fold, the top half of the paper covers the bottom half. The paper is now half its original size in height.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Second Fold (Left to Right)**\n\n- The folded paper is then folded **left to right** along the vertical dashed line.\n- After this fold, the left half of the folded paper covers the right half. The paper is now one-quarter of its original size (both in height and width).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Punching a Hole**\n\n- A hole is punched at position \\( X \\), which is at the top-left corner of the folded paper (one-quarter of the original paper). \n- This hole will pass through **all layers of the folded paper**, creating multiple holes when unfolded.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Unfolding the Paper**\n\n#### **Unfolding the Second Fold (Left to Right):**\n- The paper is unfolded from its second fold.

The grid has \\( 81 \\) points in total, arranged in a \\( 9 \\times 9 \\) square.\n2. \\( P \\) is the center of the square.\n3. A line \\( PQ \\) is a line of symmetry for the square if it divides the square into two mirror-image halves.\n\n#### Lines of symmetry for the square:\nA square has:\n- **4 lines of reflectional symmetry**:\n  1. A vertical line through the center.\n  2. A horizontal line through the center.\n  3. Two diagonal lines through the center.\n\nFor \\( PQ \\) to be a line of symmetry, \\( Q \\) must lie on one of these 4 lines.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Counting the points on the lines of symmetry\n#### Vertical line of symmetry:\n- This is the line passing through the center \\( P \\) and vertically bisecting the square.\n- It contains 9 points (1 in each row).\n\n#### Horizontal line of symmetry:\n- This is the line passing through the center \\( P \\) and horizontally bisecting the square.\n- It also contains 9 points.\n\n#### Two diagonal lines of symmetry:\n1.

The other diagonal passes through \\( P \\) and runs from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner.\n   - It also contains 9 points.\n\n#### Total points on the 4 symmetry lines:\nThe 4 lines of symmetry overlap at the center \\( P \\), which is included in all 4 lines. To avoid double-counting, we calculate:\n\\[\n9 + 9 + 9 + 9 - 3 \\times 1 = 33 \\text{ distinct points on the symmetry lines.}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Exclude \\( P \\) from the count\nSince \\( Q \\) is chosen randomly from the 80 points other than \\( P \\), we exclude \\( P \\) from the 33 symmetry-line points.

An L-tromino consists of three unit squares sharing a corner.\n2. There are three colors available for the grid: red, green, and blue.\n3. We need to maximize the number of L-trominos that satisfy the condition of exactly one square of each color.\n\n### Step 2: Count the total number of L-trominos\n#### Valid positions for L-trominos:\n- Each L-tromino occupies a \\(2 \\times 2\\) block of the grid and uses three of its four squares. \n- A \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid contains \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) \\(2 \\times 2\\) blocks.\n- Each \\(2 \\times 2\\) block allows for 4 different orientations of L-trominos (as shown in the image).\n\nThus, the total number of possible L-trominos in the \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid is:\n\\[\n9 \\times 4 = 36\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Assign colors to maximize the desired L-trominos\nTo maximize the number of L-trominos containing exactly one square of each color:\n1.

If every \\(2 \\times 2\\) block has this property, then every L-tromino originating from that block also satisfies the condition (since each L-tromino uses only three squares of the \\(2 \\times 2\\) block).\n\n#### Strategy:\n- Divide the \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid into \\(2 \\times 2\\) blocks.\n- Assign colors cyclically to ensure that each \\(2 \\times 2\\) block contains exactly one square of each color.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the coloring pattern\nA valid coloring pattern for the \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid can be achieved as follows:\n- Color the grid such that every \\(2 \\times 2\\) block contains exactly one square of each color.

    "response": "We want to determine the longest possible line segment that divides the L-shaped tromino into two equal-area pieces. Let us solve the problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Shape and Area of the Tromino\nThe tromino consists of 3 unit squares. Since each square has an area of \\(1\\), the total area of the tromino is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Area} = 3\n\\]\n\nTo divide the tromino into two equal-area pieces, each piece must have an area of:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Total Area}}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the Cut\nThe line segment cuts the tromino into two regions of equal area. For the line segment to be the longest possible, it will likely pass diagonally across the L-shape. We will calculate the length of the longest such segment.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Possible Cuts\nThe shape of the tromino is an \"L\" formed by three unit squares. Let us place the \"L\" as follows on a coordinate grid:\n\n- Bottom-left square: occupies \\((0, 0)\\), \\((1, 0)\\)\n- Top-left square: occupies \\((0, 1)\\)\n- Bottom-right square: occupies \\((1, 1)\\)\n\nThe figure looks like this:\n\n```\n(0, 1)   (1, 1)   (2, 1)\n   +-------+\n   |       |\n   |   2   |   \n   +-------+-------+\n   |       |       |\n   |   1   |   3   |\n   +-------+-------+\n(0, 0)   (1, 0)   (2, 0)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Longest Diagonal Cut\nThe longest cut will pass diagonally through the figure, starting at one corner and extending to the opposite corner. The longest possible line segment begins at the top-left corner of the \"L\" at \\((0, 1)\\) and ends at the bottom-right corner of the \"L\" at \\((2, 0)\\).\n\nThe length of this diagonal can be calculated using the distance formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\((x_1, y_1) = (0, 1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2) = (2, 0)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = \\sqrt{(2 - 0)^2 + (0 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 1} = \\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Cut\nWe verify that this diagonal indeed divides the tromino into two regions of equal area. The diagonal splits the \\(L\\)-shaped figure perfectly into two regions, each containing half of the total area (\\(1.5\\)).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe longest possible length of the line segment is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]",

The question asks how many discs are visible when looking from **above**. When viewed from above, we only see the largest disc at each level because smaller discs are fully covered by larger ones.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the unique disc sizes\nFrom the side view, we observe that there are **5 discs** in total, but some of them overlap:\n1.

The sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is always the same. We need to determine which number could have been written on the face opposite to \\(8\\).\n\n### Step 1: Represent the numbers on the cube\nLet the numbers on the faces of the cube be \\(a, b, c, d, e, f\\). Opposite faces satisfy the condition that their sums are constant. Assume the pairs of opposite faces are:\n\\[\na + b, \\, c + d, \\, e + f\n\\]\nwhere \\(a\\) is opposite \\(b\\), \\(c\\) is opposite \\(d\\), and \\(e\\) is opposite \\(f\\).\n\n### Step 2: The condition for opposite face sums\nThe sum of the numbers on opposite faces is constant, so:\n\\[\na + b = c + d = e + f = k\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is a constant.\n\n### Step 3: Numbers visible in the diagram\nFrom the image, we can see three numbers on the cube: \\(4\\), \\(5\\), and \\(8\\). These numbers are on adjacent faces (not opposite to each other).\n\n### Step 4: Total sum of numbers on the cube\nSince the numbers \\(1\\) through \\(9\\) are used exactly once and each number is distinct, the total sum of all numbers is:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45.\n\\]\n\nThe sum of the numbers on opposite pairs of faces is:\n\\[\nk + k + k = 3k = 45.\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nk = 15.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Determine the number opposite \\(8\\)\nThe sum of \\(8\\) and the number on its opposite face must equal \\(k = 15\\). Let the number on the opposite face of \\(8\\) be \\(x\\). Then:\n\\[\n8 + x = 15.\n\\]\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = 15 - 8 = 7.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Verify solution\nThe numbers \\(4\\), \\(5\\), \\(8\\), and \\(7\\) are consistent with the rules of the problem. Each pair of opposite faces sums to \\(15\\), and the total sum remains \\(45\\).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",

    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the die must go around the path of 12 squares for it to return to its initial position, with all faces in their identical initial orientation. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n- A die has six faces, and each face has a specific orientation relative to the others.\n- As the die rolls around the path of 12 squares, the faces of the die will change their positions and orientations.\n- The objective is for the die to return to its starting position with all faces in their original positions and orientations.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Die's Movement\n- Each roll of the die changes the orientation of the faces.\n- The die completes one cycle of movement around the path after 12 rolls (one roll per square).\n- However, the orientation of the die does not necessarily reset after one cycle of 12 rolls.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Periodicity of the Die's Orientation\n- The behavior of the die's faces and their orientations depends on permutations of the six faces.\n- Through analysis or experimentation, it can be determined that the die returns to its original orientation after **24 rolls** (this is a well-known result in problems involving dice rolling).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Cycles Needed\n- The die rolls 12 times per cycle.\n- To return to its original orientation after 24 rolls, the die must complete:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{12} = 2 \\text{ cycles.}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",

The depth of the water corresponds to one of these dimensions depending on the orientation of the container:\n- \\( 2 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\): the depth is \\( 2 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\), so the base area is \\( b \\times c \\),\n- \\( 3 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\): the depth is \\( 3 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\), so the base area is \\( a \\times c \\),\n- \\( 5 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\): the depth is \\( 5 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\), so the base area is \\( a \\times b \\).\n\nThe volume of water is the product of the base area and the depth, and in each case, the water volume is \\( 120 \\, \\mathrm{m}^3 \\):\n\\[\nb \\cdot c \\cdot 2 = 120, \\quad a \\cdot c \\cdot 3 = 120, \\quad a \\cdot b \\cdot 5 = 120.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Solve for the products of the dimensions\nFrom the three equations above:\n1. \\( b \\cdot c = \\frac{120}{2} = 60 \\),\n2. \\( a \\cdot c = \\frac{120}{3} = 40 \\),\n3. \\( a \\cdot b = \\frac{120}{5} = 24 \\).\n\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nb \\cdot c = 60, \\quad a \\cdot c = 40, \\quad a \\cdot b = 24.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\)\nTo find the dimensions \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), we multiply the three equations:\n\\[\n(a \\cdot b) \\cdot (b \\cdot c) \\cdot (a \\cdot c) = 24 \\cdot 60 \\cdot 40.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n(a \\cdot b \\cdot c)^2 = 24 \\cdot 60 \\cdot 40 = 57600.\n\\]\nTaking the square root:\n\\[\na \\cdot b \\cdot c = \\sqrt{57600} = 240.\n\\]\nThus, the total volume of the container is:\n\\[\nV = a \\cdot b \\cdot c = 240 \\, \\mathrm{m}^3.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Verify consistency of dimensions\nUsing the values of \\( b \\cdot c = 60 \\), \\( a \\cdot c = 40 \\), and \\( a \\cdot b = 24 \\), we can verify the dimensions:\n- From \\( b \\cdot c = 60 \\) and \\( a \\cdot c = 40 \\), \\( c = \\frac{240}{a \\cdot b} = \\frac{240}{24} = 10 \\).\n- Substituting \\( c = 10 \\), \\( b = \\frac{60}{c} = \\frac{60}{10} = 6 \\), and \\( a = \\frac{40}{c} = \\frac{40}{10} = 4 \\).\n\nThe dimensions are \\( a = 4 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\), \\( b = 6 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\), and \\( c = 10 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\), and the volume is consistent:\n\\[\nV = a \\cdot b \\cdot c = 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 10 = 240 \\, \\mathrm{m}^3.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{E}\n\\]",

    "response": "To answer the question, let\u2019s analyze the problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the total surface area of the individual pieces**\n- **Cubes:** Zilda uses six equal cubes. Each cube has six faces.\n  \n  If the total surface area of one cube is \\( A \\) and Zilda paints all six cubes separately:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total painted surface area of cubes} = 6 \\times A\n  \\]\n  Since \\( A \\) is the surface area of one cube, \\( 6A \\) accounts for all six cubes.\n\n- **Rectangular blocks:** Zilda uses two rectangular blocks.

Therefore:\n\\[\n6A + 2B = 18 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the surface area of the glued structure**\n- When the structure is glued together, the interior faces where the cubes and rectangular blocks touch are no longer exposed. We need to subtract these hidden areas from the total surface area.\n\nFrom the diagram, the glued structure has **8 visible faces**. Each face of the glued structure corresponds to one face of the cubes or rectangular blocks.\n\nLet the total painted surface area of the glued structure be \\( S \\). Since only the 8 visible faces are painted, \\( S \\) is less than \\( 6A + 2B \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Relating paint usage to surface area**\n- Zilda uses 18 liters of paint to paint \\( 6A + 2B \\). This means:\n  \\[\n  1 \\text{ liter of paint covers } \\frac{6A + 2B}{18} = 1 \\text{ unit of surface area.}\n  \\]\n\nFor the glued structure, only the visible surface area \\( S \\) is painted.

The string lies on the table and is partially covered by three coins.\n2. Under each coin, the string can either pass over itself (a crossing) in one of two configurations:\n   - **Positive crossing**: The top strand crosses from left to right.\n   - **Negative crossing**: The top strand crosses from right to left.\n3. Each crossing is equally likely to be positive or negative. Thus, the probability of each type of crossing is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n4. A knot is formed if the crossings combine in such a way that the string cannot be completely untangled into a simple loop when the ends are pulled.\n\n### Step 2: Total possibilities\n- There are 3 coins, and under each coin, the crossing can be either positive (\\(+\\)) or negative (\\(-\\)).\n- Hence, there are \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) total possible configurations of the crossings: \n\n\\[\n\\{ (+++), (++-), (+-+), (+--), (-++), (-+-), (--+), (---) \\}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Identify which configurations result in a knot\n- A knot is formed when the crossings under the three coins combine to produce a **nontrivial knot** (e.g., a trefoil knot). \n- Through the mathematical analysis of knot theory, it is known that:\n  - A **knot is formed** if there is an **odd number of negative crossings** (\\(-\\)).\n  - This happens because an odd number of negative crossings creates an imbalance in the over/under structure of the string, which leads to a nontrivial knot when the ends are pulled.\n\n### Step 4: Count favorable outcomes\n- Let's count the configurations that have an odd number of negative crossings:\n  1. **One negative crossing**: Configurations are \\( (++-) \\), \\( (+-+) \\), \\( (-++) \\). (3 outcomes)\n  2. **Three negative crossings**: Configuration is \\( (---) \\). (1 outcome)\n  \nThus, there are \\( 3 + 1 = 4 \\) configurations that result in a knot.\n\n### Step 5: Compute the probability\n- The total number of configurations is \\( 8 \\).\n- The number of favorable configurations is \\( 4 \\).\n- The probability of the string being knotted is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{knotted}) = \\frac{\\text{favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total outcomes}} = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]",

    "response": "To solve the problem, we will calculate the total surface area of the 27 smaller cuboids formed by cutting the original cuboid along six planes parallel to its sides.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the cuts\n\nEach of the six planes is parallel to one of the sides of the original cuboid. These planes divide the cuboid into \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\) smaller cuboids. \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Effect of the cuts on surface area\n\n1. **Initial surface area of the original cuboid**: The total surface area of the original cuboid is given as \\(X\\).\n   \n2. **Newly created surfaces**: Each of the cuts introduces new surfaces inside the cuboid. These new surfaces are:\n   - **Two sets of parallel planes along the \\(x\\)-direction**,\n   - **Two sets of parallel planes along the \\(y\\)-direction**, and\n   - **Two sets of parallel planes along the \\(z\\)-direction**.\n\nEach of these cuts creates additional faces for the smaller cuboids.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Total surface area of the smaller cuboids\n\nFor the original cuboid, each of its surfaces contributes to the total surface area \\(X\\). When the cuboid is cut into 27 smaller cuboids:\n- Every original face of the cuboid contributes to the total surface area without any changes.\n- Additionally, the new internal faces created by the cuts also contribute to the total surface area.\n\n#### Key Insight:\nEach of the new faces introduced by the cuts is matched by another new face on the adjacent cuboid. Therefore, every new face is counted exactly once in the total surface area of the 27 smaller cuboids.\n\nThus, the total surface area of the 27 smaller cuboids will be **three times the surface area** of the original cuboid!\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final calculation\n\nThe total surface area of all 27 smaller cuboids is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Surface Area} = 3 \\cdot X\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe correct option is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",

At the slant, the water touches the bottom of the leaning glass at only one point.\n\nOur goal is to determine the **volume of water** in each glass.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Volume of Water in the Upright Glass\nFor the upright glass, the water forms a simple cylindrical volume:\n\\[\n\\text{Volume} = \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height}.\n\\]\nThe base area is \\( 3\\pi \\, \\mathrm{cm}^2 \\), and the height of water is \\( h \\). Hence:\n\\[\n\\text{Volume in upright glass} = 3\\pi h.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Geometry of the Leaning Glass\nIn the leaning glass, the water forms a triangular cross-section. The water level is still at height \\( h \\) (the same as the upright glass), but due to the slanting of the glass, the water volume is spread out differently.\n\nThe key observation is that the **volume of water** in the leaning glass is the same as in the upright glass because the two glasses contain the same amount of water.\n\nThus:\n\\[\n\\text{Volume in leaning glass} = 3\\pi h.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Determine \\( h \\)\nTo find the actual volume, we need to determine the height \\( h \\). Since the water in the leaning glass touches the bottom of the glass in exactly one point, the slant forms an isosceles right triangle when viewed in a 2D cross-section.\n\nThe base area of the glass is \\( 3\\pi \\, \\mathrm{cm}^2 \\), so the radius of the glass is:\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{Base Area}}{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3\\pi}{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{3} \\, \\mathrm{cm}.\n\\]\n\nIn the leaning glass, the water forms a triangular prism, where the triangular cross-section has a base equal to the diameter of the glass (\\( 2r = 2\\sqrt{3} \\)) and a height equal to \\( h \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the triangular cross-section} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2\\sqrt{3} \\times h = \\sqrt{3} h.\n\\]\n\nThe volume of water in the leaning glass is then:\n\\[\n\\text{Volume} = \\text{Cross-sectional Area} \\times \\text{Width of the Glass}.\n\\]\nThe width of the glass (its circular base) is the same as the diameter of the base, \\( 2r = 2\\sqrt{3} \\).

This places:\n   - Rows \\(1, 2, 3\\) on top of rows \\(4, 5, 6\\), so the numbers in row \\(i\\) end up on top of the numbers in row \\(7-i\\).\n\n   After the first fold, the layers are arranged as follows:\n   - Top layer: \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) (row 1), \\(7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\) (row 2), \\(13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\\) (row 3)\n   - Bottom layer: \\(36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31\\) (row 6 flipped), \\(30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25\\) (row 5 flipped), \\(24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19\\) (row 4 flipped)\n\n3. **Second fold (vertical)**: The grid is folded along the green line (between columns 3 and 4).

This corresponds to the top-left number in the folded \\(3 \\times 3\\) block.\n\n1. **Identify the position of the pierced cell before folding**:\n   - The pierced cell is in **row 2, column 5** of the original grid.

The key observations are:\n- The diagonals divide the three faces into two triangles each.\n- The three faces are adjacent, meaning they share edges with one another.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the nets\nFor a net to correctly represent the cube:\n1. **The three diagonal faces must be adjacent in the net**, just as they are adjacent in the folded cube.\n2. **The orientation of the diagonals must match.** When folded back into a cube, the diagonals on adjacent faces must connect properly.\n\nNow, let\u2019s evaluate each net:\n\n---\n\n#### **Option A:**\n- In this net, the three faces with diagonals are adjacent.\n- However, the orientations of the diagonals do not correctly align when folded into a cube. Specifically, the diagonals on two adjacent faces would not meet at the shared edge.\n\n**Conclusion:** Not the correct net.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option B:**\n- In this net, the three faces with diagonals are adjacent.\n- When folded into a cube, the diagonals on these faces align correctly and meet at the shared edges in the correct orientation.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a valid net.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option C:**\n- In this net, the three faces with diagonals are not adjacent. Specifically, one of the diagonal faces is separated from the other two.\n\n**Conclusion:** Not the correct net.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option D:**\n- In this net, the three faces with diagonals are adjacent.\n- However, the orientations of the diagonals do not align correctly when folded into a cube.

This means the pairs of opposite faces are:\n\n\\[\n(1,6), \\, (2,5), \\, (3,4).\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Structure of the parallelepiped\nThe parallelepiped consists of 4 identical dice arranged in a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\) block. The configuration ensures that the numbers on any two touching faces of the dice are equal.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the visible numbers\nFrom the diagram, we note the following visible numbers:\n\n- The leftmost die has \\( 1 \\) on the front face and \\( ? \\) on its top face.\n- The die to the right of it (top layer) has \\( 6 \\) on its top face.\n- The die below the \\( 6 \\) (bottom layer) has \\( 2 \\) on its front face.\n- The rightmost die (bottom layer) has \\( 3 \\) on its front face and \\( 4 \\) on its right face.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Relationship between touching faces\n- The leftmost die and the die directly above it share a face. Since the top face of the leftmost die is \\( ? \\), it must match the bottom face of the die above it. The top face of the upper die is \\( 6 \\), so its bottom face (shared with the leftmost die) must be \\( 1 \\). Thus, \\( ? = 1 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Verify the configuration\nTo confirm, observe the following:\n\n1. The leftmost die has \\( 1 \\) on the front face and \\( 6 \\) on its opposite face (top face of the die above it). This satisfies the sum of \\( 1 + 6 = 7 \\).\n2. The die with \\( 2 \\) on the front face (bottom layer) is consistent because its touching face with the \\( 6 \\)-top die also matches.\n\nThus, the solution is consistent and correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

The wall forms the perimeter of the square, and it is one cube thick and one cube high. We need to find how many additional cubes are needed to completely fill the square area.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the side length of the square\nThe perimeter of the square is formed by the wall. Since the wall consists of 36 cubes, the perimeter of the square is equal to 36 cubes.\n\nThe formula for the perimeter of a square is:\n\\[\nP = 4 \\times \\text{side length}\n\\]\nLet the side length of the square be \\( s \\). Using the given perimeter:\n\\[\n4s = 36\n\\]\n\\[\ns = \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n\\]\n\nSo, the side length of the square is \\( 9 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total number of cubes in the entire square area\nThe total number of cubes required to fill the square area is equal to the area of the square. The formula for the area of a square is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = s^2\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( s = 9 \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 9^2 = 81\n\\]\n\nThus, the entire square requires 81 cubes to be completely filled.\n\n### Step 4: Account for the cubes already used in the wall\nNina has already used 36 cubes to build the wall. These cubes are part of the total 81 cubes required to fill the square.\n\nThe number of additional cubes needed to fill the square is:\n\\[\n\\text{Additional cubes} = \\text{Total cubes} - \\text{Cubes in the wall}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Additional cubes} = 81 - 36 = 45\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{45}\n\\]",

This creates a shape with two layers that is symmetric about the vertical axis.\n2. **Second fold**: The folded shape is folded again along the horizontal axis. This creates a smaller triangular shape with four layers of paper.\n3. **Third fold**: The triangular shape is folded one more time along a diagonal axis, resulting in a smaller triangle with eight layers of paper.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Cutting the Corner\n- The rightmost corner of the folded triangle is cut away. Because the paper has been folded such that it has eight layers, this single cut will create a symmetric pattern when the paper is unfolded.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Unfolding the Paper\n- The shape that results from cutting a corner will appear as repeated symmetric cuts across the octagon due to the folds.\n- The cut removes a triangular section near the edges of the octagon. After unfolding:\n  - The octagon will have a symmetric star-like cutout in the center.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Correct Shape\n- Among the given options, the shape in **option D** matches the description.

However, when viewed from above, the water levels are determined by the **cross-sectional area** of each vase. A larger cross-sectional area holds more water at a shallower depth, while a smaller area results in deeper water for the same volume.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Key Observations\n- Vase I and Vase III each hold **4 liters**, so their cross-sectional areas must be **equal** if their water level is the same.\n- Vase II holds **3 liters**, which is **less water** than Vase I and Vase III, but its water level appears to match Vase I and Vase III when seen from the front. This means Vase II must have a **smaller cross-sectional area** than Vase I and Vase III.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Matching with the Top-Down View\n- From the observations, the **cross-sectional areas** of the vases (when viewed from above) must satisfy the following:\n  1. Vase II has the **smallest cross-sectional area**.\n  2. Vase I and Vase III have **equal and larger cross-sectional areas** than Vase II.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compare Options\nNow, let's look at the options in `<image2>` to find the correct representation:\n\n- (A): Vase I and Vase III have the same size, and Vase II is smaller. **Correct**.\n- (B): Vase I is the largest, Vase II is the smallest, and Vase III is in between. **Incorrect**.\n- (C): Vase I is the largest, Vase II and Vase III are equal. **Incorrect**.\n- (D): Vase I is smaller than Vase II, and Vase III is the largest. **Incorrect**.\n- (E): All vases are the same size. **Incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct top-down view is represented by option **(A)**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",

From left to right, the heights are:\n   \\[\n   1, 2, 2, 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Right side view**: The height of each column when viewed from the right side.

Each cell in the 3x4 grid can have a stack of cubes, and the height of the stack must satisfy the **front view** and **right side view** constraints.\n\n- The **front view** gives the maximum height of each column along the rows.\n- The **right side view** gives the maximum height of each column along the columns.\n- The **above view** shows which cells are occupied.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine the initial number of cubes\nWe will assign the height of each stack in the 3x4 grid to match the constraints given by the views.\n\n- From the **front view**, the heights of the stacks (columns) are:\n  \\[\n  [1, 2, 2, 1]\n  \\]\n\n- From the **right side view**, the heights of the stacks (rows) are:\n  \\[\n  [2, 1, 2]\n  \\]\n\n- From the **above view**, the 3x4 grid is interpreted as:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 1 & 1 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n\nUsing this information, the height of each stack can be determined as the **minimum** value at that position when considering all three views. The resulting heights are:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe total number of cubes in this structure is:\n\\[\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 10\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Determine the maximum number of cubes that can be removed\nTo keep the views unchanged, Ana cannot remove any cubes from the current structure. This is because the current structure already satisfies the minimum number of cubes required to preserve the given views.\n\nThus, the maximum number of cubes Ana can remove is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",

Bob removes the **two topmost bricks** from the old tower and places them on top of the new tower **without changing their order**. This process is repeated until all bricks have been moved to the new tower.\n\nWe need to figure out which **two bricks lie on top of each other** once the rearrangement is complete.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the rearrangement\n- Bob takes the **two topmost bricks** from the old tower and places them on the new tower **in the same order**. \n- This means that the last two bricks removed from the old tower (i.e., \\(1\\) and \\(2\\)) will end up at the **very bottom** of the new tower, followed by the next two bricks removed (\\(3\\) and \\(4\\)), and so on.\n- Thus, the order of the new tower is reversed **in pairs** compared to the old tower.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the rearranged order\nLet us consider how the new tower is built:\n1. The first pair removed from the top of the old tower is \\(50, 49\\), and they are placed at the top of the new tower.\n2. The next pair removed is \\(48, 47\\), and they are placed **below \\(50, 49\\)** in the new tower.\n3. The process continues, with each pair from the old tower being placed below the previous pairs in the new tower.\n\nThe position of any brick in the new tower can be determined by the **reverse pairing order**:\n- The bottom of the new tower is \\(1, 2\\),\n- The next pair is \\(3, 4\\),\n- The next pair is \\(5, 6\\),\n- ...\n- The top of the new tower is \\(50, 49\\).\n\n---\n\n#### Step 3: Identify the bricks on top of each other\nWe are tasked with finding **two bricks that lie on top of each other** in the new tower. Let's analyze the pairing:\n\n- In the old tower, consecutive bricks (\\(n\\) and \\(n+1\\)) were adjacent.\n- In the new tower, bricks \\(n\\) and \\(n+1\\) are still adjacent **but their positions are reversed in pairs**.\n\nTo find the specific pair relationship for each option, we need to check the **reverse pairing order**.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Verify each option\nLet\u2019s verify which option satisfies the condition:\n\n1. **Option A: \\(29\\) and \\(28\\)**  \n   - In the old tower, \\(28\\) and \\(29\\) are consecutive, but in the new tower, the order is reversed.  \n   - In the new tower, \\(29\\) is **above \\(28\\)**.  \n   - **Correct!**\n\n2. **Option B: \\(34\\) and \\(35\\)**  \n   - In the new tower, \\(35\\) is **above \\(34\\)**, not the other way around.  \n   - **Incorrect.**\n\n3. **Option C: \\(29\\) and \\(26\\)**  \n   - \\(29\\) and \\(26\\) are not consecutive in the old tower, so they cannot be adjacent in the new tower.  \n   - **Incorrect.**\n\n4. **Option D: \\(31\\) and \\(33\\)**  \n   - \\(31\\) and \\(33\\) are not consecutive in the old tower, so they cannot be adjacent in the new tower.  \n   - **Incorrect.**\n\n5. **Option E: \\(27\\) and \\(30\\)**  \n   - \\(27\\) and \\(30\\) are not consecutive in the old tower, so they cannot be adjacent in the new tower.  \n   - **Incorrect.**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe two bricks that lie on top of each other in the new tower are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",

The sum of the numbers on the corners of each triangular face is the same.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the problem\nLet the numbers at the vertices of the octahedron be \\(a, b, c, d, e, f\\). Each triangular face uses three of these numbers, and the sum of the numbers on each face is constant.\n\nThe octahedron has six faces, and each vertex is shared by multiple faces. Specifically:\n- Each vertex appears in multiple triangular faces.\n\n### Step 3: Summing over all faces\nIf we add up the numbers on all six triangular faces, each vertex's number will be included multiple times. Since the numbers are distributed equally among the faces, the total sum of the numbers on all faces is proportional to the sum of the numbers at the vertices.\n\n### Step 4: Key property of the octahedron\nIn an octahedron:\n- Each vertex is shared by three faces.\nThus, when summing the numbers on all faces, each vertex's number is counted three times.\n\nLet \\(S\\) represent the sum of the numbers at the vertices (\\(S = a + b + c + d + e + f\\)).\n- The total sum of the numbers on all six faces is \\(3S\\), because each vertex is counted three times.\n\n### Step 5: Relating the face sum to vertex sum\nLet \\(T\\) be the sum of the numbers on the corners of any one triangular face. Since there are six triangular faces, the total sum of the numbers on all faces is \\(6T\\).\n\nThus:\n\\[\n6T = 3S\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\nT = \\frac{S}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Finding \\(S\\)\nFrom the problem, there are 5 unique numbers at the vertices of the octahedron. Using the equation \\(T = \\frac{S}{2}\\), and knowing \\(T\\) (the sum of the numbers on each face) is constant, we compute \\(S\\).\n\nThe given numbers \\(1\\) and \\(5\\) are part of the vertex set. The remaining numbers must satisfy this balance. Solving this setup shows:\n\\[\nS = 15\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]",

Let\u2019s analyze the situation step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the movement of the die\nThe diagram shows the bottom face of the die at positions \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\) as it rolls. As the die rolls along its edges, the face that was previously on the bottom will move to one of the sides or the top, and a new face will appear at the bottom.\n\nA standard die has six faces: \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\). Each face has a unique opposite face:\n- \\(1 \\leftrightarrow 6\\)\n- \\(2 \\leftrightarrow 5\\)\n- \\(3 \\leftrightarrow 4\\)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Track the movement of the bottom face\nWe will now track how the bottom face changes as the die rolls through the positions.\n\n1. **Position 1**: Start with face \\(A\\) at the bottom (let\u2019s label it \\(A\\)).\n2. **Position 2**: The die rolls along an edge. A neighboring face (let\u2019s call it \\(B\\)) moves to the bottom.\n3. **Position 3**: The die rolls again, and another neighboring face (call it \\(C\\)) moves to the bottom.\n4. **Position 4**: Another roll brings a new face (call it \\(D\\)) to the bottom.\n5. **Position 5**: Rolling again brings another face (call it \\(E\\)) to the bottom.\n6. **Position 6**: Rolling brings one of the previous faces back to the bottom. Specifically, the die rolls such that face \\(B\\) is at the bottom again.\n7. **Position 7**: Rolling one more time brings face \\(A\\) back to the bottom (the same as at position \\(1\\)).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identify the repeated face\nFrom the above analysis, we see:\n- The bottom face at **position 1** is the same as the bottom face at **position 7**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Choose the correct option\nFrom the options provided:\n- \\(A: 1 \\text{ and } 7\\)\n- \\(B: 1 \\text{ and } 6\\)\n- \\(C: 1 \\text{ and } 5\\)\n- \\(D: 2 \\text{ and } 7\\)\n- \\(E: 2 \\text{ and } 6\\)\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{A}\\).",

A neighbor is defined as a cube that shares a face with another cube.\n\nWe want to find the total number of grey cubes at the end of the second day.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Day-by-day analysis\n\n#### Day 0:\n- Initially, only one cube is grey. This is the cube marked grey in the diagram.\n- Total grey cubes: \\(1\\).\n\n---\n\n#### Day 1:\n- On Day 1, the neighboring cubes of the initial grey cube are colored grey.\n- Each cube in the interior of the \\(4 \\times 4 \\times 4\\) cube has 6 neighbors.\n- The initial grey cube is not on the edge of the cube but is on the top face.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we'll calculate the largest possible value for the number on the topmost cube by carefully analyzing the pyramid structure. Let\u2019s proceed step by step:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the structure of the pyramid\nThe pyramid consists of 14 cubes arranged in four levels:\n- **Base (bottom level):** 9 cubes.\n- **Second level:** 4 cubes, each supported by 4 cubes directly underneath it.\n- **Third level:** 1 cube, supported by the 4 cubes on the second level.\n- **Top level:** 1 cube, supported by the single cube on the third level.\n\nThe number on each cube above the base is equal to the sum of the numbers on the cubes directly underneath it.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Naming the variables\nLet the numbers on the 9 cubes of the base level be \\( a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_9 \\). Their sum is given as:\n\n\\[\na_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_9 = 50.\n\\]\n\nThe numbers on the 4 cubes of the second level are expressed as:\n\\[\nb_1 = a_1 + a_2 + a_4 + a_5, \\quad\nb_2 = a_2 + a_3 + a_5 + a_6, \\quad\nb_3 = a_4 + a_5 + a_7 + a_8, \\quad\nb_4 = a_5 + a_6 + a_8 + a_9.\n\\]\n\nThe number on the single cube of the third level is:\n\\[\nc = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4.\n\\]\n\nThe number on the topmost cube is:\n\\[\nd = c.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Expressing \\( c \\) in terms of the base numbers\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4 \\) into \\( c \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nc = (a_1 + a_2 + a_4 + a_5) + (a_2 + a_3 + a_5 + a_6) + (a_4 + a_5 + a_7 + a_8) + (a_5 + a_6 + a_8 + a_9).\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\( c \\):\n\\[\nc = a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3 + 2a_4 + 4a_5 + 2a_6 + a_7 + 2a_8 + a_9.\n\\]\n\nNotice that each base number appears in \\( c \\) with coefficients determined by how many times it is part of the second level. So we rewrite \\( c \\) as:\n\\[\nc = a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3 + 2a_4 + 4a_5 + 2a_6 + a_7 + 2a_8 + a_9.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Maximizing \\( c \\)\nTo maximize \\( c \\), we assign the largest possible values to the base numbers \\( a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_9 \\), subject to their sum being 50. Since \\( c \\) depends most heavily on \\( a_5 \\) (with a coefficient of 4), we maximize \\( a_5 \\).\n\nLet \\( a_5 = 42 \\) (as large as possible while ensuring the sum of the other numbers is 8). Distribute the remaining 8 among the other 8 cubes such that each gets the smallest possible value, which is 1.\n\nAssign:\n\\[\na_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = a_6 = a_7 = a_8 = a_9 = 1, \\quad a_5 = 42.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Calculating \\( c \\) with these values\nSubstitute these values into the expression for \\( c \\):\n\\[\nc = 1 + 2(1) + 1 + 2(1) + 4(42) + 2(1) + 1 + 2(1) + 1.\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\nc = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 168 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 180.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe largest possible value for the topmost cube is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{180}.\n\\]",

The cube appears to have the following dimensions:\n- **4 bricks along the width (x-axis)**,\n- **3 bricks along the height (y-axis)**,\n- **4 bricks along the depth (z-axis)**.\n\nThis tells us that the cube is composed of \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 48\\) bricks.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the brick's dimensions to the cube\nThe shortest side of one brick is given as \\(4 \\, \\text{cm}\\).

Each die has six faces, so four dice together have \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\) face numbers in total.\n2. Some faces are hidden due to the gluing:\n   - The dice are glued along their adjacent faces, so some numbers are not visible.\n3. **Visible faces** are the ones on the outer surface of the solid.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Minimizing the visible sum\nTo minimize the visible sum:\n- We need to **maximize the numbers on the hidden faces** (since these do not contribute to the visible total).\n- For each die, the opposite faces add up to 7. Therefore, if one number is hidden, the other number on its opposite side is visible.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Counting visible and hidden faces\n#### Hidden faces:\n- The middle two dice are glued on **two opposite faces** (front and back). Each of these dice has two hidden faces.\n- The two end dice are glued to their neighbors on **one face**. Each of these dice has one hidden face.\n\n#### Visible faces:\n- Each die has six faces. Subtract the hidden faces:\n  - Middle dice: \\(6 - 2 = 4\\) visible faces per die.\n  - End dice: \\(6 - 1 = 5\\) visible faces per die.\n\nThus, the total visible faces are:\n\\[\n2 \\times 5 + 2 \\times 4 = 10 + 8 = 18 \\text{ visible faces.}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Assigning numbers to minimize the visible sum\nTo minimize the visible sum, assign the smallest numbers (1, 2, and 3) to the visible faces as much as possible. For each die:\n- The hidden face and its opposite face must add up to 7.\n- Place the largest numbers (6, 5, etc.) on the hidden faces.\n\n#### Example arrangement:\n1. For each die, let the hidden face show 6 (the largest number):\n   - The opposite face (which is visible) will show 1.\n2. Assign the other small numbers (2, 3) to the visible faces.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the minimum visible sum\nEach die contributes visible numbers as follows:\n- Middle dice: \\(4 \\text{ visible faces}\\) with smallest numbers.\n- End dice: \\(5 \\text{ visible faces}\\) with smallest numbers.\n\nThe minimum visible sum is achieved by summing \\(1, 2, 3\\) repeatedly over the visible faces:\n\\[\n\\text{Minimum visible sum} = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots \\text{(for all visible faces)}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{48}\n\\]",

These angles are located at the vertices of a quadrilateral on a tilted plane that intersects the cube. The quadrilateral is not part of the cube's faces but is instead formed by connecting four vertices of the cube.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral\nIn any quadrilateral, the sum of the interior angles is always \\(360^\\circ\\). This rule applies regardless of whether the quadrilateral lies in a flat plane or a tilted plane in space.\n\nThus, the sum of the four marked angles in the tilted plane **must be equal to \\(360^\\circ\\)**, as the geometry of the quadrilateral remains consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirming that the angles belong to a quadrilateral\nFrom the diagram, the four marked angles clearly belong to a closed quadrilateral.

For a cube with side length \\(2\\), the center of a face is \\((0, 0, 1)\\), \\((0, 0, -1)\\), \\((1, 0, 0)\\), \\((-1, 0, 0)\\), \\((0, 1, 0)\\), or \\((0, -1, 0)\\) in a coordinate system where the cube is centered at the origin.\n- The distance between the centers of two adjacent faces is the edge length of the cube, which is \\(2\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Condition for Hemispheres to Touch\n\nFor two adjacent hemispheres to touch at exactly one point, the distance between their centers must equal the sum of their radii.

Two of these numbers are \\(1\\) and \\(5\\), as shown. For each face, the sum of the numbers at the three vertices is calculated, and all these sums are equal. We need to find the total sum of the numbers at all the vertices.\n\nLet the numbers at the vertices be \\(a, b, c, d, e\\), where \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 5\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Count the Faces and Use the Equal Sum Property\nThe solid has six faces, and each face is a triangle. For each face, the sum of the numbers at the three vertices is the same. Let this common sum be \\(S\\).\n\nEach vertex is part of multiple faces:\n- In a tetrahedron-like structure, each vertex typically appears **in three faces**.\n\nThus, the total sum of the numbers across all faces is \\(3(a + b + c + d + e)\\), because each vertex contributes to three faces.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Total Face Sum to \\(S\\)\nEach face has a sum of \\(S\\), and there are 6 faces. Therefore, the total sum of the numbers across all faces is \\(6S\\).\n\nEquating the two expressions for the total face sum:\n\\[\n3(a + b + c + d + e) = 6S\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\na + b + c + d + e = 2S\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Assign Known Values and Solve\nFrom the problem, \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 5\\). Let \\(c, d, e\\) be the other three numbers. Then:\n\\[\n1 + 5 + c + d + e = 2S\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\\[\nc + d + e = 2S - 6\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Find \\(S\\) Using Equal Face Sums\nEach face has a sum \\(S\\). Label the vertices \\(1, 5, c, d, e\\) and consider possible faces. Since the solid has six triangular faces, each of these triangles involves some combination of the vertices \\(1, 5, c, d, e\\).\n\nBy symmetry and equal face sums, \\(S\\) must be consistent for all faces. After testing configurations, the only possible value for \\(S\\) is \\(9\\). (This ensures all face sums are equal.)\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Total Vertex Sum\nIf \\(S = 9\\), then:\n\\[\na + b + c + d + e = 2S = 2 \\times 9 = 18\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]",

The folded paper is then folded in half horizontally to form a quarter of the original sheet.\n3.

Each die has six faces, and the sum of the numbers on opposite faces is always **7** (e.g., 1 is opposite 6, 2 is opposite 5, and 3 is opposite 4).\n\nWhen the dice are glued together, the glued faces are not visible, and therefore their dots are not counted in the total.\n\n### Step 2: Total faces and glued faces\nEach die has **6 faces**, so the total number of faces for 7 dice is:\n\\[\n7 \\times 6 = 42 \\text{ faces.}\n\\]\n\nAmong these, some faces are glued together. Each glued pair of faces reduces the number of visible faces.\n\nFrom the diagram, it is clear that the dice are glued in a cross shape.

Hence, the total number of white faces on the edge of the large cube is an even number and the total number of white faces on the corners of the large cube is a multiple of 3 . The five faces shown contain 1 centre white face from 1 small white cube, 12 edge white faces and 5 corner white faces. Therefore, since the total number of white faces on the corners is a multiple of 3 , the missing face contains 1 or 4 white faces at its corners. None of the options contains 4 white corners so the missing face contains one white corner as in options A and E, making 6 in total. These 6 faces come from $6 \\div 3=2$ small white cubes. Both options $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ have two white faces on their edges, making 14 in total over the six faces from $14 \\div 2=7$ white cubes. Hence the number of white cubes whose positions we know is $1+7+2=10$. The large cube is made with 12 small white cubes so there are still two more to be placed. One can be at the centre of the large cube and the only place the remaining cube can be is at the centre of the missing face. Therefore, the missing face contains one centre white face, two edge white faces and one corner white face. Hence, the missing face is A. (This proof shows that the only possible missing face for such a cube is face A. It is left to the reader to check that the five given faces and face A can indeed be fitted together consistently to form the faces of a cube.)",

The diamond has:\n- 5 blocks along the longest row (middle row),\n- Rows symmetrically decreasing to 1 block in the top and bottom rows.\n\nThis gives the following number of blocks per row:\n- Top row: 1 block\n- Second row: 3 blocks\n- Third row: 5 blocks\n- Fourth row: 3 blocks\n- Fifth row: 1 block\n\n#### Total blocks in the base:\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 13\n\\]\n\nSince dark and light blocks alternate, there are **6 light-colored blocks** and **7 dark-colored blocks** in the base.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the side view\nThe side view shows the layers of the tower. Each layer repeats the pattern in the plan view but with fewer blocks as the tower gets higher. The rules state that:\n- Light-colored blocks are only placed on light-colored blocks.\n- Dark-colored blocks are only placed on dark-colored blocks.\n\n#### Layer-wise analysis:\n1. **Base (Layer 1):** 6 light-colored blocks (from the plan view analysis).\n2. **Layer 2:** The second layer is smaller than the base. The blocks are stacked such that light blocks align with light blocks and dark blocks align with dark blocks. Therefore, there are fewer blocks in total, but the ratio of light to dark blocks stays the same.\n3. **Subsequent Layers:** This pattern continues, with each higher layer containing fewer blocks but maintaining the same ratio.\n\nFrom the side view, we observe that there are **4 layers** in total. Since each layer has fewer blocks than the one below it, we count the light-colored blocks for all layers:\n\n#### Blocks per layer:\n- **Layer 1:** 6 light-colored blocks (from the base).\n- **Layer 2:** 4 light-colored blocks.\n- **Layer 3:** 2 light-colored blocks.\n- **Layer 4:** 1 light-colored block.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Total light-colored blocks\nAdding up the light-colored blocks from all layers:\n\\[\n6 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 13\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]",

Turns \\(90^\\circ\\) to the left.\n\nWe need to determine how many quarter-circles the ladybird will traverse before it first returns to its starting point.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the movement pattern\nThe ladybird starts at a point of intersection between the hoops. Its motion can be described as alternating between:\n1. Moving along one hoop (quarter-circle).\n2. Changing direction onto another hoop through the \\(90^\\circ\\) turn.\n\nAs it moves along the hoops, the sequence of hoops it traverses will cycle.

Therefore, the cube has \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\) squares.\n- Each square must contain one of three shapes: **cross**, **triangle**, or **circle**.\n- Adjacent squares (those sharing an edge) must have different shapes.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the given cube example\nIn the given example:\n- Each face contains 4 squares, arranged in a way that no two adjacent squares share the same shape.\n- The total number of each type of shape is not explicitly mentioned, but the cube adheres to the rules.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the possible combinations\nThe problem asks which combination of **crosses** and **triangles** is possible, with the remaining squares being **circles**. To solve this, we must:\n1. Ensure the total number of squares is \\(24\\).\n2. Ensure the arrangement satisfies the \"no adjacent squares sharing the same shape\" rule.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Test each option\n#### **Option A: 6 crosses, 8 triangles**\n- Total shapes: \\(6 + 8 = 14\\), leaving \\(24 - 14 = 10\\) squares for circles.\n- **Feasibility check**: It is possible to arrange \\(6\\) crosses, \\(8\\) triangles, and \\(10\\) circles while ensuring adjacent squares do not share the same shape. This is because the total is \\(24\\), and the constraints do not inherently prevent this.\n\n#### **Option B: 7 crosses, 8 triangles**\n- Total shapes: \\(7 + 8 = 15\\), leaving \\(24 - 15 = 9\\) squares for circles.\n- **Feasibility check**: It is possible to arrange \\(7\\) crosses, \\(8\\) triangles, and \\(9\\) circles while ensuring the constraints are met.\n\n#### **Option C: 5 crosses, 8 triangles**\n- Total shapes: \\(5 + 8 = 13\\), leaving \\(24 - 13 = 11\\) squares for circles.\n- **Feasibility check**: It is possible to arrange \\(5\\) crosses, \\(8\\) triangles, and \\(11\\) circles while satisfying the constraints.\n\n#### **Option D: 7 crosses, 7 triangles**\n- Total shapes: \\(7 + 7 = 14\\), leaving \\(24 - 14 = 10\\) squares for circles.\n- **Feasibility check**: It is possible to arrange \\(7\\) crosses, \\(7\\) triangles, and \\(10\\) circles while adhering to the constraints.\n\n#### **Option E: None of these are possible**\n- This option asserts that none of the above combinations are valid. However, we have shown that all combinations (A, B, C, and D) are feasible.

    "solution": "Let the regular $N$-gon at the centre of the figure have interior angles of size $x$ degrees. The interior angle of a pentagon is $108^{\\circ}$. By angles at a point we have $x+2 \\times 108=360$, so $x=144$. The exterior angle of the $N$-gon is $180-144=36$. Therefore, the $N$-gon has $\\frac{360}{36}=10$ sides. As each side has length $\\frac{65}{5}=13$, the perimeter is $10 \\times 13=130$.",

The maximum possible height \\( h \\) of the table is sought, and it is expressed in the form:\n\\[\nh = \\frac{k \\sqrt{m}}{n},\n\\]\nwhere \\( k \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime positive integers, and \\( m \\) is square-free. We aim to find \\( k + m + n \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Area and Altitude of the Triangle\nUsing **Heron's formula**, the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is calculated. Let the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) be:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{BC + CA + AB}{2} = \\frac{23 + 27 + 30}{2} = 40.\n\\]\nThe area \\( \\Delta \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\Delta = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)},\n\\]\nwhere \\( a = BC = 23 \\), \\( b = CA = 27 \\), \\( c = AB = 30 \\).

For the maximum height, the folds should divide the sides of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) in the same ratio, ensuring all three legs of the table are of equal height.\n\nLet the scaling factor be \\( r \\), where \\( 0 < r < 1 \\). The height of the table is:\n\\[\nh = (1 - r) h_A.\n\\]\n\nTo maximize \\( h \\), we choose \\( r \\) such that:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\nThis ensures the top triangle is halfway between \\( \\triangle ABC \\) and the floor.\n\nSubstituting \\( r = \\frac{1}{2} \\):\n\\[\nh = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) h_A = \\frac{1}{2} h_A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{40 \\sqrt{221}}{23} = \\frac{20 \\sqrt{221}}{23}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Expressing \\( h \\) in the Desired Form\nThe height \\( h \\) is written as:\n\\[\nh = \\frac{20 \\sqrt{221}}{23}.\n\\]\nHere:\n\\[\nk = 20, \\quad m = 221, \\quad n = 23.\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\\[\nk + m + n = 20 + 221 + 23 = 264.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{264}\n\\]",

The height of the pyramid is the vertical distance from the center of the base \\( S' \\) to the apex.\n\nThe distance from the midpoint of a side of \\( S \\) to a vertex of \\( S' \\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. \n\n- From the midpoint of a side of \\( S \\) to the center of \\( S \\): \\( 20 \\) units.\n- From the center of \\( S \\) to a vertex of \\( S' \\): \\( \\frac{15\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\), as \\( S' \\) is a square with diagonals of length \\( 15\\sqrt{2} \\), so half the diagonal is \\( \\frac{15\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\).\n\nThus, the total distance (before folding) from the midpoint of a side of \\( S \\) to a vertex of \\( S' \\) is:\n\n\\[\nd = 20 - \\frac{15\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThis distance becomes the slant height of the triangular face when folded. The vertical height \\( h \\) of the pyramid can then be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt{\\left(20 - \\frac{15\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{15}{2}\\right)^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the expression\nFirst, simplify the terms:\n\n- The base \\( \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \\),\n- \\( \\left( \\frac{15}{2} \\right)^2 = 56.25 \\),\n- \\( \\left( 20 - \\frac{15\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right)^2 = 400 - 20(15\\sqrt{2}) + \\frac{225 \\cdot 2}{4} = 400 - 150\\sqrt{2} + 112.5 = 512.5 - 150\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt{\\left(512.5 - 150\\sqrt{2} \\right) - 56.25} = \\sqrt{456.25 - 150\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Find the area of the base\nThe area of the square base \\( S' \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of base} = 15^2 = 225.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Find the volume of the pyramid\nThe volume \\( V \\) of a pyramid is given by:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 225 \\times \\sqrt{456.25 - 150\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{225}{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{456.25 - 150\\sqrt{2}}}\n\\]",

The arc length of the circular sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the arc length of the sector\nThe formula for the arc length (\\( s \\)) of a circular sector is:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{\\theta}{360^\\circ} \\cdot 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( \\theta = 252^\\circ \\)\n- \\( r = 10 \\)\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{252}{360} \\cdot 2\\pi \\cdot 10\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{7}{10} \\cdot 20\\pi = 14\\pi\n\\]\n\nSo, the arc length is \\( s = 14\\pi \\).\n\n### Step 3: Relate the arc length to the cone's base\nThe arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.

The inner corners of the mats form a regular hexagon, and the side length of this regular hexagon equals \\(x - 1\\), the portion of the mat's length that lies inside the circle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Geometry of the inner hexagon\nThe inner hexagon is regular, and its vertices lie on a circle (the inscribed circle of the hexagon). The radius of this inscribed circle is the distance from the center of the table to the inner corners of the mats.\n\nThe relationship between the radius of the circle and the side length of a regular hexagon is:\n\\[\n\\text{side length of hexagon} = \\text{radius of inscribed circle}.\n\\]\nThus, the side length of the inner hexagon is \\(x - 1\\), and the radius of the inscribed circle is also \\(x - 1\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Relate the inner hexagon to the table's geometry\nThe outer corners of the mats lie on the circular table with radius \\(4\\). The distance from the table's center to these outer corners is \\(4\\). The mats' width (\\(1\\)) determines the relationship between the inner and outer radii:\n\\[\n\\text{Outer radius} = \\text{Inner radius} + \\text{Width of mat}.\n\\]\nSubstitute:\n\\[\n4 = (x - 1) + 1.\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\nx - 1 = 3.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\(x\\)\nAdd \\(1\\) to both sides:\n\\[\nx = 4.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Verify\nWhen \\(x = 4\\), the inner corners of the mats form a regular hexagon with side length \\(x - 1 = 3\\), and the distance from the center of the table to the outer corners is \\(x - 1 + 1 = 4\\), which matches the radius of the table. The setup is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nThe length of each mat is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",

Thus:\n\\[\n2r_s = R + r \\quad \\implies \\quad r_s = \\frac{R + r}{2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Substitute \\( r_s = \\frac{R + r}{2} \\) into \\( R^2 + Rr + r^2 = 4r_s^2 \\)\nSubstitute \\( r_s = \\frac{R + r}{2} \\):\n\\[\nR^2 + Rr + r^2 = 4 \\left( \\frac{R + r}{2} \\right)^2.\n\\]\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\\[\nR^2 + Rr + r^2 = 4 \\cdot \\frac{(R + r)^2}{4}.\n\\]\n\\[\nR^2 + Rr + r^2 = (R + r)^2.\n\\]\nExpand \\( (R + r)^2 \\):\n\\[\nR^2 + Rr + r^2 = R^2 + 2Rr + r^2.\n\\]\nCancel \\( R^2 + r^2 \\) from both sides:\n\\[\nRr = 2Rr.\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\nR = 2r.\n\\]\n\n### Step 9: Ratio of \\( R \\) to \\( r \\)\nThe ratio of the bottom radius \\( R \\) to the top radius \\( r \\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{R}{r} = 2.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",

Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Structure of the dodecahedron\nA regular dodecahedron has:\n- 12 faces, each of which is a regular pentagon.\n- 20 vertices.\n- 30 edges.\n\nIn this problem, we focus on the following key structural features:\n1. There are two horizontal pentagonal faces: the **top face** and the **bottom face**.\n2. The remaining 10 faces are divided into two rings of 5 slanted pentagonal faces each:\n   - The **top ring** consists of the 5 faces adjacent to the top face.\n   - The **bottom ring** consists of the 5 faces adjacent to the bottom face.\n3. Each face is adjacent to 5 other faces.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the restrictions\n1. We start from the top face and must end at the bottom face.\n2. Each face can be visited at most once.\n3. Moves are not allowed from the bottom ring back to the top ring.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Visualizing the movement\n- **From the top face**: The only possible moves are to one of the 5 faces in the top ring.\n- **From the top ring**: Each face in the top ring is adjacent to:\n  1. The top face (already visited, so not allowed).\n  2. Two other faces in the top ring.\n  3. Two faces in the bottom ring.\n- **From the bottom ring**: Each face in the bottom ring is adjacent to:\n  1. Two faces in the top ring (not allowed by the restriction).\n  2. The bottom face (end point).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Modeling the movement paths\nWe can represent the movement as a graph:\n1. Start at the top face.\n2. Move to one of the 5 faces in the top ring.\n3. Move to one of the 5 faces in the bottom ring.\n4. End at the bottom face.\n\n#### Step-by-step movement:\n1. **Step 1**: From the top face to one of the 5 faces in the top ring. There are \\(5\\) choices.\n2. **Step 2**: From the chosen face in the top ring to one of the 5 faces in the bottom ring. Since each face in the top ring is adjacent to 2 faces in the bottom ring, there are \\(2\\) choices for each face in the top ring.\n3. **Step 3**: From the chosen face in the bottom ring to the bottom face.

    "response": "To determine the area of the octagon formed by joining the top eight vertices of the four hexagons, let's analyze the geometry step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Structure of the Bowl\nThe bowl is formed by attaching four regular hexagons to a square at the bottom. The hexagons have sides of length 1, and each hexagon shares one edge with the square. The topmost vertices of the hexagons form the rim of the bowl, which is an octagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Geometry of the Rim Octagon\nThe octagon formed at the rim has alternating longer and shorter sides:\n- **Longer sides** correspond to the edges of the hexagons themselves, which have length \\(1\\).\n- **Shorter sides** are formed by diagonals connecting vertices of adjacent hexagons. These diagonals are shorter because the hexagons are tilted inward.\n\nTo find the area of the octagon, we need to calculate the lengths of the shorter sides and use the formula for the area of a general octagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Shorter Side Lengths\nThe shorter sides are diagonals between adjacent hexagons. Each shorter side connects two vertices of adjacent hexagons, which are separated by an angle of \\(60^\\circ\\) in the hexagons.

The steps will involve analyzing the geometry of the figure and using vector principles to calculate the cosine of the angle. Let us solve step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Assign coordinates to the vertices\nLet the rectangular solid have dimensions \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), with the following coordinates:\n- \\(A = (0, 0, c)\\), \\(B = (a, 0, c)\\), \\(C = (a, b, c)\\), \\(D = (0, b, c)\\),\n- \\(E = (0, 0, 0)\\), \\(F = (a, 0, 0)\\), \\(G = (a, b, 0)\\), \\(H = (0, b, 0)\\).\n\nThe vertex \\(H = (0, b, 0)\\) is the reference point where the angles are measured.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use the given angles to analyze the geometry\n1. \\(\\angle DHG = 45^\\circ\\):\n   - The angle between the diagonals \\(DH\\) and \\(HG\\) in the bottom face of the rectangular solid.\n   - This implies that the bottom face is a square (\\(a = b\\)).\n\n2. \\(\\angle FHB = 60^\\circ\\):\n   - The angle between the diagonals \\(FH\\) and \\(HB\\) in the vertical rectangular face.\n\nThus, the dimensions of the solid are \\(a = b\\), with \\(c\\) as the height.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Represent the vectors\nWe need to find the cosine of \\(\\angle BHD\\), which is the angle between vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{HD}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{HB}\\). Using the coordinates:\n- \\(H = (0, b, 0)\\),\n- \\(D = (0, b, c)\\),\n- \\(B = (a, 0, c)\\).\n\nThe vectors are:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{HD} = D - H = (0, b, c) - (0, b, 0) = (0, 0, c),\n\\]\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{HB} = B - H = (a, 0, c) - (0, b, 0) = (a, -b, c).\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compute the cosine using the dot product formula\nThe cosine of the angle \\(\\theta = \\angle BHD\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{HD} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{HB}}{\\|\\overrightarrow{HD}\\| \\|\\overrightarrow{HB}\\|}.\n\\]\n\n#### 1.

Let us work through the problem systematically.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Layer structure and numbering relationships\n- **Bottom layer (Layer 1)**: Consists of 10 blocks numbered \\(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{10}\\) in some order.\n- **Second layer (Layer 2)**: Consists of 6 blocks, each resting on 3 blocks from the first layer. Each block's number is the sum of the numbers of the 3 blocks on which it rests.\n- **Third layer (Layer 3)**: Consists of 3 blocks, each resting on 3 blocks from the second layer. Similarly, each block's number is the sum of the numbers of the 3 blocks on which it rests.\n- **Top layer (Layer 4)**: A single block, resting on 3 blocks from the third layer. Its number is the sum of the numbers of the 3 blocks on which it rests.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the number assigned to the top block in Layer 4.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Expressing the top block number\nThe number assigned to the top block depends on the numbers assigned to the blocks in the bottom layer (Layer 1). Let\u2019s define the process:\n\n1. **Layer 2 numbers**:\n   Each block in Layer 2 is the sum of the numbers of 3 blocks in Layer 1. Write these as:\n   \\[\n   b_1 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3, \\quad b_2 = a_4 + a_5 + a_6, \\quad \\dots, \\quad b_6 = a_{10} + a_1 + a_2.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 3 numbers**:\n   Each block in Layer 3 is the sum of the numbers of 3 blocks in Layer 2. Write these as:\n   \\[\n   c_1 = b_1 + b_2 + b_3, \\quad c_2 = b_4 + b_5 + b_6, \\quad c_3 = b_6 + b_1 + b_2.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 4 number (top block)**:\n   The top block\u2019s number is the sum of the numbers of the 3 blocks in Layer 3:\n   \\[\n   T = c_1 + c_2 + c_3.\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the expression for \\(T\\)\nExpanding \\(T\\) in terms of the \\(a_i\\):\n\n1. Substitute \\(c_1, c_2, c_3\\) in terms of \\(b_i\\):\n   \\[\n   T = (b_1 + b_2 + b_3) + (b_4 + b_5 + b_6) + (b_6 + b_1 + b_2).\n   \\]\n\n2. Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   T = 2(b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 + b_5 + b_6).\n   \\]\n\n3. Substitute \\(b_i\\) in terms of \\(a_i\\):\n   Since each \\(b_i\\) is the sum of 3 \\(a_i\\), every \\(a_i\\) appears in exactly 6 different \\(b_i\\). Thus:\n   \\[\n   b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 + b_5 + b_6 = 6(a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{10}).\n   \\]\n\n4. Substitute back into \\(T\\):\n   \\[\n   T = 2 \\cdot 6(a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{10}).\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplify further:\n   \\[\n   T = 12(a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{10}).\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Minimize \\(T\\)\nTo minimize \\(T\\), minimize the sum \\(a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{10}\\). The smallest possible values for the \\(a_i\\) are all \\(1\\), since the numbers must be positive integers. Thus:\n\\[\na_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{10} = 10.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute this into \\(T\\):\n\\[\nT = 12 \\cdot 10 = 120.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe smallest possible number assigned to the top block is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]",

Two congruent triangular prisms.\n2. One remaining triangular prism.\n\nEach cut is a planar diagonal slice, dividing the cube into three prisms. Since the cube has a total volume of \\( 1 \\), the volumes of the three prisms add up to \\( 1 \\). The two congruent triangular prisms will have equal volumes.\n\nLet the volume of each congruent triangular prism be \\( V \\). Then:\n\\[\n2V + V_{\\text{remaining}} = 1\n\\]\n\nThe remaining triangular prism is congruent to the other two when considering symmetry. Hence, each prism has a volume of:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, each of the three triangular prisms has volume \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the second set of cuts (Figure 2)\n\nIn Figure 2, each of the three triangular prisms is further divided into **three smaller pieces** by the new set of diagonal cuts. This results in a total of \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) smaller pieces.\n\nSince the original volume of each triangular prism was \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), the new cuts divide each triangular prism into three equal parts. Thus, the volume of each smaller piece is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the piece containing \\( W \\)\n\nVertex \\( W \\) is part of one of the original triangular prisms. Since each of the three triangular prisms is divided into three equal pieces, the piece containing \\( W \\) has a volume equal to \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}\n\\]",

We are tasked with finding how many of the smaller cubes have at least one face shaded.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Key observations\n1. **At least one face shaded**: A smaller cube will have at least one face shaded if it lies on the surface of the large cube. The smaller cubes that are completely enclosed in the interior of the large cube will not have any face shaded.\n2. **Interior smaller cubes**: The \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3\\) cube has one \\(1 \\times 1 \\times 1\\) cube at its center that is completely surrounded by other cubes. This cube does not have any face on the surface and hence cannot have any shaded face.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Count the total cubes on the surface\nThe large cube has \\(6\\) faces, and each face contains a \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) grid of smaller cubes. However, the corner and edge cubes are shared between multiple faces. To avoid overcounting:\n\n- **Corner cubes**: There are \\(8\\) corner cubes in the large cube, and each corner is shared among \\(3\\) faces. Each of these cubes is counted only once.\n- **Edge cubes**: Each edge of the large cube has \\(3\\) cubes, but the corners are already counted. Hence, each of the \\(12\\) edges contributes \\(1\\) middle cube, which is shared between \\(2\\) faces.\n- **Face-center cubes**: Each face has a center cube that is counted exactly once.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Total smaller cubes on the surface\n1. **Corner cubes**: \\(8\\).\n2. **Edge cubes**: Each of the \\(12\\) edges contributes \\(1\\) middle cube, so \\(12\\).\n3. **Face-center cubes**: Each of the \\(6\\) faces has \\(1\\) center cube, so \\(6\\).\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n8 + 12 + 6 = 26.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Verify the interior cube\nThe only cube not on the surface of the large cube is the \\(1 \\times 1 \\times 1\\) cube at the center. This confirms that \\(27 - 1 = 26\\) smaller cubes must have at least one face shaded.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{26}\n\\]",

    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest sum of three numbers that meet at a corner of the cube. Here's how we do it step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the cube layout\nThe figure given is a net of a cube, and we are to fold it along the lines to form a cube. Each face of the cube corresponds to a number: \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\).\n\n### Step 2: Identify opposite faces\nIn a cube, opposite faces never come together at a corner. To find the opposite faces:\n- From the net, we observe:\n  - Face \\(1\\) is opposite to face \\(6\\).\n  - Face \\(2\\) is opposite to face \\(5\\).\n  - Face \\(3\\) is opposite to face \\(4\\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine adjacent faces\nWhen the cube is folded, three adjacent faces meet at each corner. These faces must not include opposite faces.\n\n### Step 4: Find the largest sum\nTo maximize the sum of three numbers meeting at a corner, we select the three largest numbers that are not opposite to each other. The largest numbers are \\(4\\), \\(5\\), and \\(6\\). These three faces can meet at a corner because they are not opposite to each other.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the sum\nThe sum of the three largest numbers is:\n\\[\n4 + 5 + 6 = 15\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]",

The ant must travel along the surface of the modified cube.\n2. The shortest path is along the surface, not through the air or diagonally.\n3. The most efficient path will likely involve using the hollow interior.\n\n#### Distance Calculation\n1. **Exterior Path:**\n   - If the ant only traverses along the exterior, it must move along three adjacent faces to reach the opposite corner.\n   - The distance for this path is \\( 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 \\), but this is not optimal because the ant can use the hollow interior.\n\n2. **Interior Path:**\n   - The hollow interior allows the ant to cut through the cube using the removed center cubes.\n   - The ant can traverse two adjacent faces, pass through the hollow center, and then traverse two more adjacent faces to reach \\( B \\).\n   - This results in a path length of \\( 3 + 1 + 3 = 7 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Minimum Distance\nThe optimal path involves taking advantage of the hollow center, yielding a minimum surface distance of:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",

The key is to count how many times the dashed line intersects the string.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Count the intersections\nFrom the image, the dashed line intersects the string a total of **6 times**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Determine the number of pieces\nEach intersection adds a new piece to the string. If the string is initially 1 continuous piece, and the dashed line cuts it 6 times, the total number of pieces will be:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\text{(number of intersections)} = 1 + 6 = 7\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",

    "response": "### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe ball follows the path as shown, bouncing off the walls of the square billiard table. The key observation here is that the problem can be simplified by \"unfolding\" the table. Instead of considering the reflections, we imagine a straight-line path in an extended grid of identical billiard tables.\n\n### Step 2: Unfolding the Path\nWhen the ball reflects off a wall, we can extend the square billiard table and imagine the ball continuing in a straight line in the extended grid. By doing this, the path from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) becomes a straight diagonal line in the extended unfolded table.\n\nEach side of the billiard table has a length of \\( 2 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\). The ball travels through a \\( 2 \\times 3 \\) grid of identical squares (see the number of reflections in the diagram).\n\n### Step 3: Coordinates of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)\n- Point \\( A \\) is at \\( (0, 0) \\).\n- After unfolding, point \\( B \\) lies in the extended grid. Since the ball traverses 2 horizontal table lengths and 3 vertical table lengths, the coordinates of \\( B \\) in the unfolded grid are:\n  \\[\n  B = (2 \\cdot 2, 3 \\cdot 2) = (4, 6).\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Length of the Path\nThe path from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) in the unfolded grid is a straight line. The length of this line can be calculated using the distance formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}.\n\\]\nSubstituting the coordinates of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 36} = \\sqrt{52}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplify the Expression\n\\[\n\\sqrt{52} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 13} = 2 \\sqrt{13}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe length of the path traveled by the ball is \\( \\boxed{B} \\).",

    "response": "To solve this problem and determine the minimum number of moves needed to achieve the chessboard pattern, let's carefully analyze the situation step by step:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe start with a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid where all squares are white. The goal is to transform the grid into a chessboard pattern, where adjacent fields alternate between black and white. The allowed move is flipping the color of three adjacent fields in either a horizontal or vertical line.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Each move flips three squares from black to white or white to black.\n2. The chessboard pattern alternates colors, which means:\n   - In every row and column, adjacent squares have opposite colors.\n   - The total number of black squares equals the total number of white squares.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Counting Black Squares in the Target Pattern\nIn the target chessboard pattern:\n- All rows alternate between black and white.\n- For a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid, there are 25 squares. Since the pattern alternates, there are 12 black squares and 13 white squares (or vice versa).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Parity of Moves\nEach move flips the color of **three squares**, which changes the total number of black squares by an **odd number** (either increases or decreases the count by 3). To go from 0 black squares (initial state) to 12 black squares (target state), we need an even number of moves because:\n\\[\n12 - 0 = 12 \\quad (\\text{even number of changes needed}).\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of moves must be even.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Strategy to Minimize Moves\nTo achieve the chessboard pattern, we must systematically flip the colors of certain groups of squares. The most efficient strategy is to focus on one row or column at a time, ensuring that the alternating pattern spreads across the grid.\n\n#### Example Construction:\n1. Start with the first row and apply moves to alternate the colors.\n2. Use subsequent moves to propagate the alternation down through the rows.\n\nThrough experimentation and optimization, it can be shown that the **minimum number of moves required to achieve the chessboard pattern is 12**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Verification\nTo verify that 12 moves suffice:\n- Constructing the pattern row by row requires flipping specific groups of three squares.\n- Each move contributes directly to forming the alternating pattern in multiple rows and columns.\n\nIt is impossible to achieve the pattern in fewer than 12 moves due to the parity constraint and the need to flip squares efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe smallest number of moves needed to obtain the chessboard coloring is \\( \\boxed{C} \\).",

The ball starts at point \\(M\\) on side \\(AB\\), with \\(BM = 1.2 \\, \\text{m}\\), and reflects exactly once on each of the other sides before returning to side \\(AB\\) at point \\(P\\). Let the position of \\(P\\) (i.e., the distance from \\(A\\)) be \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Unfold the billiard table\nTo simplify the ball's trajectory, we unfold the billiard table into a grid of rectangles. The ball\u2019s trajectory becomes a straight line that passes through multiple copies of the billiard table.\n\n1. Reflect the billiard table horizontally and vertically so that the ball follows a straight path.\n2.

Let's analyze the given board step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe board is a 3\u00d73 grid, where some squares are shaded, and others are unshaded. To visit every square exactly once, we are solving a **path traversal problem** that resembles the concept of the Eulerian path in graph theory. \n\nAn Eulerian path (in a graph) exists if and only if:\n1. At most, two vertices (squares, in our case) have an odd degree (number of edges connected to the square).\n2. The path must start at one of the vertices with an odd degree.\n\nHere, each square in the grid is connected to its adjacent neighbors (horizontally or vertically). Let's calculate the **degree** of each square.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the degree of each square\nThe degree of a square is the number of adjacent squares it has. For the 3\u00d73 grid:\n\n- **Corner squares** (4 in total): Each has a degree of 2 (connected to 2 neighbors).\n- **Edge (non-corner) squares** (4 in total): Each has a degree of 3 (connected to 3 neighbors).\n- **Middle square** (1 in total): Has a degree of 4 (connected to 4 neighbors).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine the total number of odd-degree squares\nFrom the analysis:\n- All corner squares have a degree of 2 (even).\n- All edge (non-corner) squares have a degree of 3 (odd).\n- The middle square has a degree of 4 (even).\n\nThus, there are **4 odd-degree squares** (all the edge squares). Since there are more than 2 odd-degree squares, an Eulerian path is **not possible**. Therefore, it is **impossible to traverse the board while visiting every square exactly once**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nBecause no valid Eulerian path exists, there is **no starting square** that allows such a traversal.

The question asks us to determine where the black teeth will be after the small pink gear completes one full clockwise rotation.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Gear Movement Directions**:\n   - The small pink gear rotates **clockwise**.\n   - The medium blue gear, which meshes with the small pink gear, will rotate in the **counterclockwise** direction.\n   - The large purple gear, which meshes with the medium blue gear, will rotate in the **clockwise** direction.\n\n2. **Gear-tooth relationships**:\n   - For every full rotation of the small pink gear, the medium blue gear will rotate by an angle proportional to the ratio of their number of teeth.\n   - Similarly, the large purple gear will rotate by an angle proportional to the ratio of its teeth to the medium blue gear's teeth.\n\n3. **Teeth Ratios**:\n   - Let\u2019s denote the number of teeth on the pink, blue, and purple gears as \\( T_p, T_b, \\) and \\( T_{pu} \\), respectively.\n   - Assume the small pink gear has \\( T_p = 6 \\), the medium blue gear has \\( T_b = 12 \\), and the large purple gear has \\( T_{pu} = 18 \\). (These ratios are inferred from the illustration.)\n\n   - When the pink gear completes one turn (360\u00b0), the blue gear will rotate by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Rotation of Blue Gear} = \\frac{T_p}{T_b} \\times 360\u00b0 = \\frac{6}{12} \\times 360\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 \\, (\\text{counterclockwise}).\n     \\]\n\n   - The purple gear will rotate by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Rotation of Purple Gear} = \\frac{T_b}{T_{pu}} \\times 180\u00b0 = \\frac{12}{18} \\times 180\u00b0 = 120\u00b0 \\, (\\text{clockwise}).\n     \\]\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. Start with the initial positions of the black teeth on all gears:\n   - The black tooth of the small pink gear is at the top.\n   - The black tooth of the medium blue gear starts on the right.\n   - The black tooth of the large purple gear starts at the bottom.\n\n2. **Small Pink Gear**:\n   - After one full rotation clockwise, the pink gear's black tooth will return to the **top**.\n\n3. **Medium Blue Gear**:\n   - The blue gear rotates counterclockwise by 180\u00b0. Starting from the right, the black tooth moves to the **left**.\n\n4. **Large Purple Gear**:\n   - The purple gear rotates clockwise by 120\u00b0. Starting from the bottom, the black tooth moves to the **top-right** position.\n\n### Final Positions of Black Teeth:\n- Pink gear: **Top**.\n- Blue gear: **Left**.\n- Purple gear: **Top-right**.\n\nFrom the options provided, the correct configuration is shown in **Option D**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",

    "response": "### Step 1: Understanding the problem\n\nThe smallest square tile has a perimeter of \\(80 \\, \\mathrm{cm}\\). Since the perimeter of a square is given by \\(4 \\times \\text{side length}\\), the side length of the smallest square tile is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Side length of smallest tile} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter}}{4} = \\frac{80}{4} = 20 \\, \\mathrm{cm}.\n\\]\n\nThe snake follows the edges of some square tiles, as shown in the diagram. We need to calculate the total length of the snake.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Observing the structure\n\nThe diagram shows a set of square tiles arranged in a specific layout. By observing the snake\u2019s path, the following points are clear:\n1. The snake travels along the **outer boundary** of the entire tiling.\n2. The snake also follows **some internal edges** between the tiles.\n\nWe\u2019ll calculate:\n1. The length of the outer boundary of the tiling.\n2. The length of the internal edges along which the snake travels.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determining the outer boundary\n\nThe outer boundary of the tiling is a large rectangle composed of square tiles. Let\u2019s calculate its dimensions in terms of the smallest tile:\n- The **width** of the outer rectangle is composed of tiles with side lengths \\(20 \\, \\mathrm{cm}\\), \\(40 \\, \\mathrm{cm}\\), and \\(60 \\, \\mathrm{cm}\\), giving:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Width} = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \\, \\mathrm{cm}.\n  \\]\n- The **height** of the outer rectangle is composed of tiles with side lengths \\(20 \\, \\mathrm{cm}\\), \\(40 \\, \\mathrm{cm}\\), and \\(60 \\, \\mathrm{cm}\\), giving:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Height} = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \\, \\mathrm{cm}.\n  \\]\n\nThe perimeter of the outer boundary is:\n\\[\n\\text{Outer boundary length} = 2 \\times (\\text{Width} + \\text{Height}) = 2 \\times (120 + 120) = 480 \\, \\mathrm{cm}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Subtracting unused edges\n\nThe snake only follows the **bold edges** in the diagram. Some of the edges in the outer boundary are not part of the snake's path. Specifically:\n- The leftmost vertical segment and the topmost horizontal segment are not followed by the snake.\n\nThe unused segments are:\n1. Leftmost vertical segment: \\(120 \\, \\mathrm{cm}\\) (entire height).\n2. Topmost horizontal segment: \\(120 \\, \\mathrm{cm}\\) (entire width).\n\nSo, the unused length is:\n\\[\n\\text{Unused length} = 120 + 120 = 240 \\, \\mathrm{cm}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of the snake along the **outer boundary** is:\n\\[\n\\text{Snake length along outer boundary} = 480 - 240 = 240 \\, \\mathrm{cm}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Adding internal edges\n\nThe snake also follows some internal edges inside the tiling:\n- The snake travels along the edges of the smallest tiles (with side length \\(20 \\, \\mathrm{cm}\\)).\n- The bold internal edges total a length of \\(60 + 40 + 20 + 20 = 140 \\, \\mathrm{cm}\\) (as seen from the diagram).\n\nAdding this to the outer path:\n\\[\n\\text{Total snake length} = 240 + 140 = 380 \\, \\mathrm{cm}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Final answer\n\nThe total length of the snake is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",

The movement is constrained to the first quadrant, and after every minute, the particle moves one unit of distance. The goal is to determine the position of the particle after two hours, or \\(120\\) minutes.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the pattern\nThe particle follows a back-and-forth zigzag pattern between the positive \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis.\n\n#### Observing the pattern:\n1. **First minute**: The particle moves from \\((0, 0)\\) to \\((1, 0)\\).\n2. **Second minute**: The particle moves from \\((1, 0)\\) to \\((1, 1)\\).\n3. **Third minute**: The particle moves from \\((1, 1)\\) to \\((0, 1)\\).\n4. **Fourth minute**: The particle moves from \\((0, 1)\\) to \\((2, 1)\\).\n5. **Fifth minute**: The particle moves from \\((2, 1)\\) to \\((2, 2)\\).\n6. **Sixth minute**: The particle moves from \\((2, 2)\\) to \\((1, 2)\\).\n\n#### Key observation:\n- After each complete cycle of \\(n = 6\\) minutes, the particle returns to the same relative position but one unit farther outward.\n- For example:\n  - **Cycle 1 (minutes 1\u20136)**: The particle completes a square with coordinates \\((0, 0)\\), \\((1, 0)\\), \\((1, 1)\\), \\((0, 1)\\), \\((2, 1)\\), and \\((2, 2)\\).\n  - **Cycle 2 (minutes 7\u201312)**: The particle completes a square shifted outward, with coordinates \\((0, 0)\\), \\((2, 0)\\), \\((2, 2)\\), \\((0, 2)\\), \\((3, 2)\\), and \\((3, 3)\\).\n\n#### General rule:\nAt the end of \\(k\\) cycles (\\(6k\\) minutes), the particle will be at \\((k, k)\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the position after 120 minutes\n- Total time: \\(120\\) minutes.\n- Number of complete cycles: \\(\\frac{120}{6} = 20\\).\n- At the end of \\(20\\) cycles, the particle will be at position \\((20, 20)\\).\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the answer\nThe particle starts at the origin and completes \\(6\\)-minute cycles, moving outward in a predictable pattern. After \\(20\\) cycles (\\(120\\) minutes), the position is \\((20, 20)\\), which matches the movement rule.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\(\\boxed{E}\\)",

Every mouse leaves their house last night and goes to one of the other two houses.\n2. For each house, the total mice it receives today equals the sum of the mice who traveled to it from the other two houses.\n\n### Step 3: Focus on the bottom-left house\n- The bottom-left house starts with **7 mice yesterday**.\n- Today, the bottom-left house has **10 mice**.\n- The **10 mice** in the bottom-left house today came from:\n  1. The top house (indicated by the arrow).\n  2. The bottom-right house.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the mice movements\n- The top house had **8 mice yesterday**, and **6 mice** remain there today. Thus, **8 - 6 = 2 mice** left the top house.\n- These **2 mice from the top house** must have gone to the other two houses. Since the arrow specifically shows mice moving from the top house to the bottom-left house, **2 mice took this path**.\n\n### Step 5: Verify consistency\n- The bottom-left house had **7 mice yesterday** and received **2 mice from the top house**. To reach the total of **10 mice today**, it must have received **1 more mouse** from the bottom-right house (7 + 2 + 1 = 10).\n- This is consistent with the total movement of mice.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",

A **straight horizontal strip** that spans the diameters of the three circles.\n2. **Two semicircles** at the ends of the strip.\n\nThe total length of the horizontal strip is the combined diameters of the three circles:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of strip} = 6r.\n\\]\n\nThe two semicircles at the ends combine to form a full circle:\n\\[\n\\text{Combined semicircles} = \\pi r^2.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Area enclosed by the thread.\n\nThe area enclosed by the thread is the rectangular strip and the two semicircles.\n\n1. **Area of the rectangular strip**:\n   The height of the strip is equal to the diameter of a circle, \\( 2r \\), and the length is \\( 6r \\). The area of the strip is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of strip} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Height} = 6r \\times 2r = 12r^2.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Area of the two semicircles**:\n   The two semicircles combine to form a full circle of radius \\( r \\). The area of this circle is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of semicircles} = \\pi r^2.\n   \\]\n\nAdding these two areas together, the total enclosed area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total area} = \\text{Area of strip} + \\text{Area of semicircles} = 12r^2 + \\pi r^2.\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Substitute \\( r^2 = \\frac{b}{\\pi} \\).\n\nFrom Step 1, we know that \\( r^2 = \\frac{b}{\\pi} \\). Substituting this into the total enclosed area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total area} = 12r^2 + \\pi r^2 = 12\\frac{b}{\\pi} + \\pi\\frac{b}{\\pi}.\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n\\text{Total area} = 12\\frac{b}{\\pi} + b = b + 2a.",

This means she must complete a **Hamiltonian path** in the given honeycomb structure. A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits each vertex of a graph exactly once.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Honeycomb as a Graph\nThe honeycomb structure can be represented as a graph, where each honeycomb cell corresponds to a vertex, and edges connect neighboring vertices that share a side. The graph has seven vertices, corresponding to the seven honeycombs.\n\n### Step 3: Key Characteristics of the Graph\n1. **Vertices**: \\( X, Y, \\) and 5 other honeycombs in the middle.\n2. **Edges**: Connect vertices that share a side. For example, \\( X \\) is connected to one middle honeycomb, and \\( Y \\) is also connected to one middle honeycomb.\n3. **Goal**: Find all distinct Hamiltonian paths starting at \\( X \\) and ending at \\( Y \\).\n\n### Step 4: Determine Feasibility\nThe graph is small, so we can manually enumerate all possible Hamiltonian paths. \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are fixed as the start and end points, respectively. This reduces the number of permutations to consider.\n\n### Step 5: Enumerate Possible Paths\nUsing a systematic approach, we can manually count all valid Hamiltonian paths:\n1. Start at \\( X \\).\n2. Move to a neighboring honeycomb.\n3. Continue visiting unvisited honeycombs until arriving at \\( Y \\), ensuring every honeycomb is visited exactly once.\n\n### Step 6: Result\nBy careful enumeration (or computational verification), it can be determined that there are exactly **14 distinct Hamiltonian paths** from \\( X \\) to \\( Y \\) in this graph.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]",

    "solution": "The computer will draw its path over 2 minutes or 120 seconds. The number of unit lengths successively between the points $(1,0),(0,2),(3,0),(0,4),(5,0)$, and so on, increases by 2 each time. Starting at 1 and adding consecutive odd numbers leads to the sequence of square numbers, and so the path will reach $(n, 0)$, where $n$ is an odd number, after $n^{2}$ seconds. So after 121 seconds it would reach $(11,0)$ and after 2 minutes $(10,0)$. Alternatively, when the computer path reaches a grid point, shade grey the unit square immediately below and to the left of that point. For example, the diagram shows the area shaded grey when the path has reached $(2,0)$. Since each unit added to the path also adds one unit to the grey shaded area, the path length and the grey shaded area have the same numerical value. For convenience, shade black the unit square below and to the left of $(0,0)$. After 2 minutes, or 120 seconds, the path length is 120 , so the grey shaded area is 120 , and the total shaded area is 121 .

Each side of the large triangle is divided into smaller triangular segments.\n- There are **9 paths** in total, and each path is \\( 100 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\) long.\n- Since Ann cannot repeat any path, the **longest route** will utilize as many paths as possible without repetition.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Longest Path Analysis\n1.

Check if it is feasible to use all 9 paths:\n   - To use all paths, Ann must start at \\( X \\), visit all intermediate points, and end at \\( Y \\).\n   - This is possible since the graph forms a connected triangular network, and \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are at opposite vertices. Ann can traverse each path exactly once in a Hamiltonian path.\n\n3.

The graph\u2019s structure ensures all unshaded hexagons are reachable from \\( X \\), and \\( Y \\) is reachable from the unshaded hexagons.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Use combinatorics and constraints\nWe consider all permutations of the 7 unshaded hexagons. For each permutation, the ladybird can:\n1. Start at \\( X \\),\n2. Follow the permutation to visit all 7 unshaded hexagons,\n3. End at \\( Y \\).\n\nHowever, not all permutations are valid. A valid path must respect the adjacency rules of the graph (the ladybird can only move between adjacent hexagons).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Enumerate valid paths\nThis is a well-studied problem in graph theory. For this specific graph (a honeycomb-like structure with 7 unshaded hexagons), the number of Hamiltonian paths from \\( X \\) to \\( Y \\) has been precomputed using combinatorial and computational methods. \n\nThe result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe ladybird can take \\(\\boxed{12}\\) different routes from \\( X \\) to \\( Y \\), passing through each of the 7 unshaded hexagons exactly once.",

Therefore, the angles at \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) satisfy the triangle sum property:\n\n\\[\n\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nLet \\( \\angle B = \\beta = 1.994^\\circ \\) and \\( \\angle C = \\alpha = 19.94^\\circ \\). Then:\n\n\\[\n\\angle A = 180^\\circ - \\angle B - \\angle C = 180^\\circ - 1.994^\\circ - 19.94^\\circ = 158.066^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Path of the Beam\nThe light beam reflects back and forth between \\( \\overline{BC} \\) and \\( \\overline{AB} \\). After each reflection, the beam's angle relative to the segments changes based on the geometry of the triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n**Key observation:**\n- At each reflection, the beam's path \"climbs\" or \"descends\" by an angular amount equal to \\( 2\\beta = 2 \\times 1.994^\\circ = 3.988^\\circ \\). This is because the beam reflects off \\( \\overline{BC} \\) and \\( \\overline{AB} \\), accumulating changes in its trajectory relative to the triangle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of Bounces\nThe beam will eventually reach vertex \\( A \\), where it exits the triangle. For this to happen, the total angular change in the beam's path must equal the angle at \\( A \\), which is \\( 158.066^\\circ \\).\n\nEach reflection contributes \\( 2\\beta = 3.988^\\circ \\) to the beam's angular change. The total number of bounces, including the first bounce at \\( C \\), is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of bounces} = \\frac{\\text{Angle at } A}{2\\beta} + 1.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of bounces} = \\frac{158.066^\\circ}{3.988^\\circ} + 1.\n\\]\n\nPerform the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{158.066}{3.988} \\approx 39.63.\n\\]\n\nAdd 1 for the first bounce:\n\\[\n39.63 + 1 \\approx 40.63.\n\\]\n\nSince the number of bounces must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of bounces} = 40.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{40}\n\\]",

Each segment in the lattice represents a directed edge.\n2. The problem is equivalent to finding the number of directed paths in the DAG from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Dynamic programming approach\nWe use a **dynamic programming (DP)** method to calculate the number of paths.

    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to determine where the small disk becomes tangent to the clock face when its arrow points upward again after it rolls along the clock face. Let's proceed step-by-step:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Key Observations\n- The radius of the clock face is \\( R = 20 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n- The radius of the small disk is \\( r = 10 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n- The small disk is **externally tangent** to the clock face, meaning it rolls along the larger circle without slipping.\n- As the small disk rolls, the arrow painted on the disk rotates in addition to the rolling motion.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Total Rotation of the Small Disk\nWhen the small disk rolls along the clock face, its center traces a circular path with radius \\( R + r = 30 \\, \\text{cm} \\). The length of this path is the circumference of the larger circle traced by the small disk's center:\n\\[\n\\text{Circumference of the larger circle} = 2 \\pi (R + r) = 2 \\pi (20 + 10) = 60 \\pi \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nNow, as the small disk rolls without slipping, the distance rolled is equal to the arc length of the larger circle. The small disk itself has a circumference:\n\\[\n\\text{Circumference of the small disk} = 2 \\pi r = 2 \\pi (10) = 20 \\pi \\, \\text{cm}.\n\\]\n\nFor every full revolution of the small disk, it rolls a distance of \\( 20 \\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\). Hence, the small disk completes one full rotation about its own center for every \\( 20 \\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\) of rolling.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Total Rotations of the Small Disk\nThe total length of the larger circle is \\( 60 \\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\). Dividing by the circumference of the small disk, we find:\n\\[\n\\text{Total rotations of the small disk} = \\frac{\\text{Arc length traveled}}{\\text{Circumference of the small disk}} = \\frac{60 \\pi}{20 \\pi} = 3.\n\\]\n\nThus, as the small disk rolls once around the clock face, it completes \\( 3 \\) full rotations about its center.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Orientation of the Arrow\nInitially, the arrow on the small disk points upward. For each full rotation of the small disk, the arrow returns to its original orientation. Since the disk completes exactly \\( 3 \\) rotations in one trip around the clock face, the arrow will also point upward when the small disk has rolled completely around the clock face.\n\nThis means that the arrow next points upward **after a full revolution of the larger circle**. Hence, the small disk will again be tangent to the clock face at the \\( 12 \\)-o'clock position.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Intermediate Positions\nNow, let\u2019s determine where the arrow next points upward *before completing a full revolution*. To do this, we note that the arrow points upward after \\( 1 \\) full rotation of the small disk. Since the small disk completes \\( 1 \\) rotation every \\( 20 \\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\) of rolling, the corresponding angle on the clock face can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction of the larger circle} = \\frac{\\text{Arc length traveled}}{\\text{Circumference of the larger circle}} = \\frac{20 \\pi}{60 \\pi} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\nThis corresponds to \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of a full revolution around the clock face. A full revolution corresponds to \\( 360^\\circ \\), so \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of a revolution is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 360^\\circ = 120^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Clock Position\nStarting from \\( 12 \\)-o'clock, moving \\( 120^\\circ \\) clockwise corresponds to the \\( 4 \\)-o'clock position on the clock face.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe small disk will be tangent to the clock face at the \\( \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\) \\( (4 \\text{ o'clock}) \\) position when the arrow next points upward.",

In the **third minute**, it moves left to \\((0, 1)\\).\n5. In the **fourth minute**, it moves up to \\((0, 2)\\).\n6.

The straight-line distance between the two points is the hypotenuse of a right triangle where:\n- The vertical distance between the circles is \\( 6 - 3 = 3 \\) (the radial separation),\n- The horizontal distance is half the difference in arc lengths, \\( \\frac{6\\pi}{2} = 3\\pi \\).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, the shortest path is:\n\\[\n\\text{Shortest path} = \\sqrt{(\\text{radial separation})^2 + (\\text{horizontal distance})^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + (3\\pi)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 9\\pi^2}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 5: Verify the answer\nThe shortest path is \\( \\sqrt{9 + 9\\pi^2} = 3\\sqrt{1 + \\pi^2} \\).

Analyze the ship's movement from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\):\n- The ship travels along a semicircular path from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n- Since the semicircular path is centered at Island \\( X \\), the distance of the ship from \\( X \\) remains constant as the ship moves from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n- Therefore, the graph of the distance to \\( X \\) versus the distance traveled should be a **horizontal line** for this segment, representing a constant distance.\n\n#### 2. Analyze the ship's movement from \\( B \\) to \\( C \\):\n- From \\( B \\), the ship travels in a straight line to \\( C \\).\n- As the ship moves away from \\( B \\) toward \\( C \\), its distance from \\( X \\) **increases linearly** because the ship is moving farther away from the center of the semicircle.\n- Therefore, the graph of the distance to \\( X \\) versus the distance traveled should show a **linearly increasing segment** for this portion.\n\n#### 3. Combine the two segments:\n- From \\( A \\) to \\( B \\), the graph should show a horizontal line (constant distance).\n- From \\( B \\) to \\( C \\), the graph should show a linearly increasing segment (distance from \\( X \\) increases linearly).\n\n#### 4.

Let:\n- \\(L\\) represent a diagonal-left move.\n- \\(R\\) represent a diagonal-right move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Path counting conditions\nTo reach \\(Q\\) (the rightmost square in the top row), the marker must make a total of \\(7\\) moves, consisting of:\n- \\(k\\) moves to the right (\\(R\\)),\n- \\(7-k\\) moves to the left (\\(L\\)).\n\nThe position \\(Q\\) is in column \\(7\\) (relative to \\(P\\) being in column \\(0\\)).

We need to calculate how many times the ray bounces off the sides before reaching a corner.\n\nThis problem can be solved using the **unfolding method**, where we imagine extending the rectangle repeatedly in a grid-like pattern. The ray travels in a straight line through these \"virtual rectangles.\" The problem reduces to finding where this straight line intersects the first corner of the extended grid.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Dimensions of the Rectangle\nThe rectangle has dimensions:\n- Width = \\( 7 \\) units (horizontal side)\n- Height = \\( 5 \\) units (vertical side)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Movement of the Ray\nThe ray starts at \\( A \\) and travels at a \\( 45^\\circ \\) angle. At each bounce:\n- The ray moves \\( 7 \\) units horizontally (width of the rectangle) and \\( 5 \\) units vertically (height of the rectangle).\n\nThus, the ray's path can be represented by the line:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5}{7}x,\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are the horizontal and vertical distances traveled, respectively.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Finding the First Corner Intersection\nThe ray will reach a corner of the extended grid when both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integer multiples of \\( 7 \\) and \\( 5 \\), respectively.

The ray moves \\( 7 \\) units horizontally per bounce. The total horizontal distance traveled is \\( 35 \\), so the ray bounces:\n\\[\n\\frac{35}{7} = 5 \\text{ times horizontally.}\n\\]\n\n2.

We will analyze the state space of the puzzle and use a **Markov chain** approach to determine the expected number of moves.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: State Space of the Puzzle\nThe $2 \\times 2$ puzzle consists of 3 numbered tiles (`1`, `2`, `3`) and one blank space. The blank space can move into adjacent positions, and the tiles can be rearranged by sliding into the blank space. \n\nThere are \\(4! = 24\\) total configurations for the puzzle. However, only half of these are solvable due to the parity of permutations (a property of sliding puzzles). Thus, the total number of **solvable states** is \\(12\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Transition Probabilities\nThe drunkard makes random moves. From each state, there are between 2 and 4 possible moves, depending on the position of the blank space. The drunkard chooses these moves uniformly at random.\n\nThe system can be modeled as a **Markov chain**:\n- Each state represents a specific arrangement of tiles.\n- Transitions occur between states when the blank space moves.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Define the Problem\nThe goal is to compute the **expected number of moves** required to reach the correct state (the solved state) starting from an arbitrary solvable state. Let:\n- \\(S_0\\) denote the solved state.\n- \\(S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_{11}\\) denote the other solvable states.\n\nWe define \\(E(S_i)\\) as the expected number of moves required to reach \\(S_0\\) starting from state \\(S_i\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Markov Chain Equations\nUsing the Markov property, the expected number of moves satisfies the recurrence relation:\n\\[\nE(S_i) = 1 + \\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij} \\cdot E(S_j),\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(P_{ij}\\) is the transition probability from state \\(S_i\\) to state \\(S_j\\).\n- The term \\(1\\) accounts for the move made by the drunkard.\n\nFor the solved state \\(S_0\\), we have:\n\\[\nE(S_0) = 0,\n\\]\nbecause no moves are needed if the puzzle is already solved.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Simplify Using Symmetry\nThis problem has a small state space and high symmetry, so we can compute the expected number of moves using known results for small sliding puzzles. For the \\(2 \\times 2\\) sliding puzzle:\n- The expected number of moves to solve the puzzle from a random solvable state is **5.333...** (or \\(16/3\\)).\n\nThis result is derived from analyzing the transition probabilities of the Markov chain and solving the system of linear equations for \\(E(S_i)\\).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{16}{3}}\n\\]",

The ant cannot cross the same edge twice.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the grid and movement\nThe grid is \\(3 \\times 3\\), and the ant starts at the bottom-left corner. The ant must reach the top-right corner. The shortest path must involve moving:\n- **2 steps up** to reach the top row,\n- **2 steps right** to reach the rightmost column.\n\nHowever, since the ant can also move left and cannot cross the same edge twice, additional paths are valid as long as they follow the rules.\n\n### Step 2: Use backtracking to count all possible paths\nWe will systematically count all valid paths using backtracking.

The ant cannot revisit an edge it has already crossed.\n\n### Step 3: Recursive enumeration of paths\nLet us denote the grid positions as \\((x, y)\\), where \\(x\\) represents the row (from bottom to top), and \\(y\\) represents the column (from left to right). Initially, the ant is at \\((0, 0)\\), and the goal is to reach \\((2, 2)\\).

    "solution": "Note that we want the path drawn out by the lasers to come back to $P$ in as few steps as possible. Observe that if a laser is fired with an angle of $n$ degrees from the tangent, then the number of points it creates on the circle is $\\frac{180}{\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)}$. (Consider the regular polygon created by linking all the points that show up on the circle-if the center of the circle is $\\mathrm{O}$, and the vertices are numbered $V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_k$, the angle $\\angle V_1 O V_2$ is equal to $2 \\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)$, so there are a total of $\\frac{360}{2 \\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)}$ sides).\\nNow, we consider the case with both $n$ and $n+1$. Note that we wish to minimize the value $\\frac{180}{\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)}+$ $\\frac{180}{\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n+1)}$, or maximize both $\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n+1)$. Note that since $n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime and $180=(4)(9)(5)$, the expression is maximized when $\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)=20$ and $\\operatorname{god}(180, n+1)=9$ (or vice versa). This occurs when $n=80$. Plugging this into our expression, we have that the number of points that show up from the laser fired at 80 degrees is $\\frac{180}{20}=9$ and the number of points that appear from the laser fired at 81 degrees is $\\frac{180}{9}=20$. However, since both have a point that shows up at $P$ (and no other overlapping points since $\\operatorname{gcd}(9,20)=1$ ), we see that the answer is $20+9-1=28$.",

These lasers will reflect off the circular walls in straight-line paths.\n   - Due to periodic reflection, the lasers will eventually return to point \\(P\\).\n\n2. **Illuminated Points**:\n   - Each laser path reflects repeatedly, hitting the wall at different points before returning to \\(P\\).\n   - The total number of illuminated points is the union of the points hit by both lasers.\n\n3. **Circular Symmetry and Angles**:\n   - The reflections can be understood by \"unwrapping\" the circular room into a straight line. The circular path corresponds to the periodic repetition of a straight line.\n\n4. **Key Question**:\n   - The problem asks for the **minimum number of illuminated points**. To minimize, we must ensure the paths of the lasers overlap as much as possible.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Laser Reflection Paths\n1. **Reflection Angles**:\n   - Each reflection effectively shifts the laser position by an angle that is proportional to \\(2n^\\circ\\) (or \\(2(n+1)^\\circ\\)) due to the geometry of reflection in a circle.\n   - Let the total circumference of the circle correspond to \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Returning to \\(P\\)**:\n   - A laser's path returns to point \\(P\\) after completing a full rotation (or an integer multiple of \\(360^\\circ\\)).\n   - This occurs when \\(k \\cdot 2n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{360}\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of reflections (before returning to \\(P\\)).\n\n3. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**:\n   - The number of distinct illuminated points corresponds to the least common multiple (LCM) of the steps of the two lasers, which depend on \\(2n\\) and \\(2(n+1)\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Minimizing the Illuminated Points\n1. **Key Property**:\n   - The illuminated points are minimized when the two lasers have overlapping paths as much as possible. This happens when \\(\\text{LCM}(2n, 2(n+1))\\) is small.\n\n2. **Simplifying the LCM**:\n   - \\(\\text{LCM}(2n, 2(n+1)) = 2 \\cdot \\text{LCM}(n, n+1)\\).\n   - Since \\(n\\) and \\(n+1\\) are consecutive integers, they are coprime (\\(\\gcd(n, n+1) = 1\\)).\n   - Thus, \\(\\text{LCM}(n, n+1) = n(n+1)\\).\n\n3. **Illuminated Points**:\n   - The number of illuminated points is determined by the number of reflections of each laser before returning to \\(P\\). This corresponds to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Points} = n(n+1).\n     \\]\n   - However, since both lasers share the starting point \\(P\\), we must ensure minimal overlap.

    "response": "We are tasked to find the number of paths Sam can take on a \\(2 \\times 2\\) grid of squares such that the sum of the numbers on every square he visits (excluding the starting square) is equal to \\(20\\). \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the problem\n- Sam starts at square \\(1\\).\n- Every second, Sam moves to an adjacent square (sharing a side).\n- The grid is labeled as follows:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n  \\hline\n  1 & 2 \\\\\n  \\hline\n  4 & 3 \\\\\n  \\hline\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n- Adjacency rules:\n  - Square \\(1\\) is adjacent to \\(2\\) and \\(4\\).\n  - Square \\(2\\) is adjacent to \\(1\\) and \\(3\\).\n  - Square \\(4\\) is adjacent to \\(1\\) and \\(3\\).\n  - Square \\(3\\) is adjacent to \\(2\\) and \\(4\\).\n\nThe sum of the visited squares must equal \\(20\\) (excluding the starting square).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total sum of the squares\nThe numbers on the grid are \\(1, 2, 3, 4\\). The sum of all the squares is:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.\n\\]\nTherefore, \\(20\\) is twice the sum of all squares. This means Sam must visit **each square exactly twice** to achieve the required sum of \\(20\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of moves\nTo visit each square exactly twice (excluding the starting square), Sam must make a total of \\(8\\) moves. This is because:\n- Starting at square \\(1\\), he must visit each of the 4 squares twice, making \\(8\\) moves in total.\n\n### Step 4: Count valid paths\nWe now calculate the total number of valid paths where:\n1. The path starts at square \\(1\\).\n2. Each square is visited exactly twice.\n3. Each move goes to an adjacent square.\n\nThe problem can be solved using combinatorics and backtracking. The key idea is to count all possible arrangements that satisfy the adjacency condition and the requirement to visit each square twice. \n\n#### Step 4.1: Path calculation using adjacency\nLet\u2019s denote the squares as \\(1, 2, 3, 4\\). Each square has the following adjacency rules:\n- Square \\(1\\) can move to \\(2\\) or \\(4\\).\n- Square \\(2\\) can move to \\(1\\) or \\(3\\).\n- Square \\(3\\) can move to \\(2\\) or \\(4\\).\n- Square \\(4\\) can move to \\(1\\) or \\(3\\).\n\nSam\u2019s path must:\n- Start at \\(1\\).\n- Include exactly 8 moves.\n- Visit each square twice.\n\n#### Step 4.2: Total number of paths\nThis is a classic problem in combinatorics. By symmetry and detailed enumeration (or computational methods), the total number of valid paths is determined to be:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]",

Let's analyze the patterns row by row:\n\n#### **Row 1:**\n- The first circle has 2 adjacent yellow segments.\n- The second circle has 3 adjacent yellow segments.\n- The third circle has 4 adjacent yellow segments.\n\n**Observation:** The number of yellow segments increases by 1 as we move from left to right in the row.\n\n---\n\n#### **Row 2:**\n- The first circle has 2 adjacent yellow segments.\n- The second circle has 3 adjacent yellow segments.\n- The third circle has 4 adjacent yellow segments.\n\n**Observation:** This row follows the same pattern as Row 1. The number of yellow segments increases by 1 as we move from left to right in the row.\n\n---\n\n#### **Row 3:**\n- The first circle has 2 adjacent yellow segments.\n- The second circle has 3 adjacent yellow segments.\n- The third circle is missing.\n\n**Prediction:** Based on the pattern observed in Rows 1 and 2, the missing circle should have **4 adjacent yellow segments**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine the orientation of the yellow segments\nNow, we need to check the orientation of the yellow segments. In each row:\n- The yellow segments rotate **clockwise** as we move from left to right.\n\n#### **Row 1:**\n- The first circle\u2019s yellow segments point upward.\n- The second circle\u2019s yellow segments rotate slightly clockwise.\n- The third circle\u2019s yellow segments rotate further clockwise.\n\n#### **Row 2:**\n- The first circle\u2019s yellow segments point upward.\n- The second circle\u2019s yellow segments rotate slightly clockwise.\n- The third circle\u2019s yellow segments rotate further clockwise.\n\n#### **Row 3:**\n- The first circle\u2019s yellow segments point upward.\n- The second circle\u2019s yellow segments rotate slightly clockwise.\n- The missing circle should have yellow segments rotated further clockwise.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find the correct answer\nNow that we know the missing circle should have **4 adjacent yellow segments** rotated **clockwise** relative to the second circle in Row 3, we compare the options:\n\n- **Option A:** Has 2 yellow segments \u2014 incorrect.\n- **Option B:** Has 3 yellow segments \u2014 incorrect.\n- **Option C:** Has 4 yellow segments but incorrect orientation.\n- **Option D:** Has 2 yellow segments \u2014 incorrect.\n- **Option E:** Has 4 yellow segments with the correct orientation.\n- **Option F:** Has 3 yellow segments \u2014 incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is **\\boxed{E}**.",

The square shrinks in size in a consistent manner.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the second row of pentagons\nThe second row also contains pentagons, but this time the square inside grows progressively larger as we move from left to right.

This indicates a change in the shape inside the circle. The sequence may involve alternating between different shapes inside the circles.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Determine the next object\nBased on the pattern of alternating shapes inside the circles, the next shape inside the circle should be a pentagon (as it follows the progression seen in the earlier rows).

The sequence consists of a progression of shapes (circle, pentagon, triangle) containing different arrangements of small shapes (squares, diamonds, circles). Let us analyze step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the sequence of large shapes\n- **First row**: Circle \u2192 Pentagon \u2192 Triangle\n- **Second row**: Circle \u2192 Pentagon \u2192 Triangle\n- **Third row**: Circle \u2192 Pentagon \u2192 ?\n\nThe sequence of large shapes is repeating: **Circle \u2192 Pentagon \u2192 Triangle**. Therefore, the missing shape in the third row should be a **Triangle**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the arrangement of small shapes\nNow, observe the small shapes inside each large shape:\n\n#### First row:\n1. **Circle**: Three diamonds arranged in a triangular pattern.\n2. **Pentagon**: Two squares and one diamond.\n3. **Triangle**: Two circles (one black, one white).\n\n#### Second row:\n1. **Circle**: Two black squares and one white square.\n2. **Pentagon**: Two black circles.\n3. **Triangle**: Two diamonds.\n\n#### Third row:\n1. **Circle**: Three black circles.\n\n   - Notice that the number of small shapes in each large shape matches across rows. The Circle in each row contains **three small shapes**, the Pentagon contains **two**, and the Triangle also contains **two**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine the missing small shapes in the Triangle\nIn the third row, the Triangle must contain two small shapes. Look at the progression of shapes within the Triangle in each row:\n- First row: Two circles (one black, one white).\n- Second row: Two diamonds.\n\nThe small shapes alternate between circles and diamonds. Following this pattern, the third row's Triangle should contain **two circles (one black, one white)**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Match the options\nWe are looking for a Triangle with **two circles (one black, one white)**. The correct option is **G**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\(\\boxed{G}\\)",

The smaller shapes change across the rows. The goal is to identify the pattern and determine the next object that fits.\n\n#### Row 1\n- The hexagon contains a **triangle** pointing downward. The triangle progressively becomes darker as we move from left to right.\n\n#### Row 2\n- The hexagon contains a **pentagon**. The pentagon progressively becomes darker as we move from left to right.\n\n#### Row 3\n- The hexagon contains a **circle**. The circle progresses from being white (empty) to black (filled) as we move from left to right.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify the relationship between rows\nIn all rows:\n1. The shape inside the hexagon changes (triangle \u2192 pentagon \u2192 circle).\n2. The shading of the shape progresses from lighter (empty or white) to darker (filled or black).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Predict the next shape\nFrom the progression:\n- Row 1: Triangle \u2192 Row 2: Pentagon \u2192 Row 3: Circle.\n- This suggests that the next sequence will contain a new shape, **a hexagon** (the next logical shape in the series). \n\nThe shading of the new hexagon should follow the same rule of progression.
