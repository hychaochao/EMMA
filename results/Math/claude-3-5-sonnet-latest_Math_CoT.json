Therefore, a correctly arranged set of these dominoes will have four spots at one end and six spots at the other, as is currently the case. Hence, Paul does not need to move either of the end dominoes.

Finally, rotating the third domino in diagram 3, he obtains the correctly arranged line as shown in diagram 4 . This shows that it is possible to arrange the dominos correctly in three moves.  To see that two moves is not sufficient, note that, whatever else needs to happen, the two $1 \\mathrm{~s}$ must be correctly placed next to each other. To do that requires one of the dominos with a 1 to be rotated and then one pair of dominos to be swapped so that the two $1 \\mathrm{~s}$ are now next to each other.

Hence, the total number of white faces on the edge of the large cube is an even number and the total number of white faces on the corners of the large cube is a multiple of 3 . The five faces shown contain 1 centre white face from 1 small white cube, 12 edge white faces and 5 corner white faces. Therefore, since the total number of white faces on the corners is a multiple of 3 , the missing face contains 1 or 4 white faces at its corners. None of the options contains 4 white corners so the missing face contains one white corner as in options A and E, making 6 in total. These 6 faces come from $6 \\div 3=2$ small white cubes. Both options $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ have two white faces on their edges, making 14 in total over the six faces from $14 \\div 2=7$ white cubes. Hence the number of white cubes whose positions we know is $1+7+2=10$. The large cube is made with 12 small white cubes so there are still two more to be placed. One can be at the centre of the large cube and the only place the remaining cube can be is at the centre of the missing face. Therefore, the missing face contains one centre white face, two edge white faces and one corner white face. Hence, the missing face is A. (This proof shows that the only possible missing face for such a cube is face A. It is left to the reader to check that the five given faces and face A can indeed be fitted together consistently to form the faces of a cube.)",

Therefore quadrilateral $O A B C$ is a rhombus and hence its diagonal $A C$ is a line of symmetry. Therefore, if vertex $B$ is folded onto $O$, the fold will be along $A C$. Similarly, if vertices $D$ and $F$ are folded onto $O$, the  ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_27_9b94075f4aebf6f0284ag-1.jpg?height=277&width=309&top_left_y=2077&top_left_x=1459) folds will be along $C E$ and $E A$ respectively. Hence the figure that is formed will be a triangle and, since all three of the rhombuses $O A B C, O C D E$ and $O E F A$ are made out of two congruent equilateral triangles, the lengths of their diagonals $A C, C E$ and $E A$ will be equal.

    "solution": "On a normal cube, the ant would like to walk on a straight line on the net of the cube. In this special cube with holes in the middle, the ant would ideally want to travel as spacially close to the space diagonal as possible while still traveling in a straight line on the net. To do this, it can travel in two separate straight line segments from $A$ to $P$ to $B$, where $P$ is the midpoint of the edge it lies on. By symmetry, notice how the path from $A$ to $P$ is the same length as the path from $P$ to $B$. So, our answer is just twice the length of the path from $A$ to $P$. We can unfold the net as shown below.\\n\\nHere, we can see that the length of the path from $A$ to $P$ is $\\sqrt{2^2+\\frac{5}{2}^2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2}$. So, our answer is $2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2}=\\sqrt{41}$.",

The number of unit lengths successively between the points $(1,0),(0,2),(3,0),(0,4),(5,0)$, and so on, increases by 2 each time. Starting at 1 and adding consecutive odd numbers leads to the sequence of square numbers, and so the path will reach $(n, 0)$, where $n$ is an odd number, after $n^{2}$ seconds. So after 121 seconds it would reach $(11,0)$ and after 2 minutes $(10,0)$. Alternatively, when the computer path reaches a grid point, shade grey the unit square immediately below and to the left of that point. For example, the diagram shows the area shaded grey when the path has reached $(2,0)$. Since each unit added to the path also adds one unit to the grey shaded area, the path length and the grey shaded area have the same numerical value. For convenience, shade black the unit square below and to the left of $(0,0)$. After 2 minutes, or 120 seconds, the path length is 120 , so the grey shaded area is 120 , and the total shaded area is 121 . But $121=11^{2}$, so that the total shaded area is a square of side 11 and the path has reached $(10,0)$. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_27_0f4ed2787981bb911326g-038.jpg?height=385&width=412&top_left_y=2149&top_left_x=1413)",

    "solution": "Note that we want the path drawn out by the lasers to come back to $P$ in as few steps as possible. Observe that if a laser is fired with an angle of $n$ degrees from the tangent, then the number of points it creates on the circle is $\\frac{180}{\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)}$. (Consider the regular polygon created by linking all the points that show up on the circle-if the center of the circle is $\\mathrm{O}$, and the vertices are numbered $V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_k$, the angle $\\angle V_1 O V_2$ is equal to $2 \\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)$, so there are a total of $\\frac{360}{2 \\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)}$ sides).\\nNow, we consider the case with both $n$ and $n+1$. Note that we wish to minimize the value $\\frac{180}{\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)}+$ $\\frac{180}{\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n+1)}$, or maximize both $\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n+1)$. Note that since $n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime and $180=(4)(9)(5)$, the expression is maximized when $\\operatorname{gcd}(180, n)=20$ and $\\operatorname{god}(180, n+1)=9$ (or vice versa). This occurs when $n=80$. Plugging this into our expression, we have that the number of points that show up from the laser fired at 80 degrees is $\\frac{180}{20}=9$ and the number of points that appear from the laser fired at 81 degrees is $\\frac{180}{9}=20$. However, since both have a point that shows up at $P$ (and no other overlapping points since $\\operatorname{gcd}(9,20)=1$ ), we see that the answer is $20+9-1=28$.",
